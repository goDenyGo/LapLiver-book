abstract = {In the late 1980s, laparoscopy was essentially a gynecologist's tool. One of the French private surgeons, Phillipe Mouret of Lyon, shared his surgery practice with a gynecologist and thus had access to both laparoscopic equipment and to patients requiring laparoscopy. In March of 1987, Mouret carried out his first cholecystectomy by means of electronic laparoscopy. Although he never published anything about this experience, the news on his technique reached Francois Dubois of Paris. Although having no prior laparoscopic experience, Dubois acted immediately. He borrowed the instruments from gynecologists, performed his first animal experiments and, in April 1988, carried out the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in Paris. Inspired by Dubois, Jacques Perissat of Bordeaux, introduced endoscopic cholecystectomy in his clinic and presented this technique at a SAGES meeting in Louisville in April 1989. Very soon, news of the French work in LC soon swept beyond the country's borders. Dubois and Perissat spoke enthusiastically about their work at the meetings and were largely responsible for establishing what is today called the French technique.},

This report describes our experience with three women who had benign lesions of the liver edge found incidentally during laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic symptoms. The first women was managed traditionally with subsequent exploratory laparotomy; she developed ileus postoperatively and required a 5-day hospital stay. The other two were managed laparoscopically without incident. Each was hospitalized less than 24 hours. All three liver lesions proved benign on histologic examination. Although not all liver lesions can or should be excised laparoscopically, selected superficial neoplasms can be managed expediently by a laparoscopic approach.},

abstract = {The beginnings of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) were at the start of the 1990s, with the initial reports being published in 1991 and 1992. These were followed by reports of left lateral sectionectomy in 1996. In the years following, the procedures of LLR were expanded to hemi-hepatectomy, sectionectomy, segmentectomy and partial resection of posterosuperior segments, as well as the parenchymal preserving limited anatomical resection and modified anatomical (extended and/or combining limited) resection procedures. This expanded range of LLR procedures, mimicking the expansion of open liver resection in the past, was related to advances in both technology (instrumentation) and technical skill with conceptual changes. During this period of remarkable development, two international consensus conferences were held (2008 in Louisville, KY, United States, and 2014 in Morioka, Japan), providing up-to-date summarizations of the status and perspective of LLR. The advantages of LLR have become clear, and include reduced intraoperative bleeding, shorter hospital stay, and - especially for cirrhotic patients-lower incidence of complications (e.g., postoperative ascites and liver failure). In this paper, we review and discuss the developments of LLR in operative procedures (extent and style of liver resections) during the first quarter century since its inception, from the aspect of relationships with technological/technical developments with conceptual changes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The European Guidelines Meeting on Laparoscopic Liver Surgery was held in Southampton on February 10 and 11, 2017 with the aim of presenting and validating clinical practice guidelines for laparoscopic liver surgery. BACKGROUND The exponential growth of laparoscopic liver surgery in recent years mandates the development of clinical practice guidelines to direct the speciality's continued safe progression and dissemination. METHODS A unique approach to the development of clinical guidelines was adopted. Three well-validated methods were integrated: the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology for the assessment of evidence and development of guideline statements; the Delphi method of establishing expert consensus, and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument for the assessment of the methodological quality and external validation of the final statements. RESULTS Along with the committee chairman, 22 European experts; 7 junior experts and an independent validation committee of 11 international surgeons produced 67 guideline statements for the safe progression and dissemination of laparoscopic liver surgery. Each of the statements reached at least a 95{\%} consensus among the experts and were endorsed by the independent validation committee. CONCLUSION The European Guidelines Meeting for Laparoscopic Liver Surgery has produced a set of clinical practice guidelines that have been independently validated for the safe development and progression of laparoscopic liver surgery. The Southampton Guidelines have amalgamated the available evidence and a wealth of experts' knowledge taking in consideration the relevant stakeholders' opinions and complying with the international methodology standards.},

abstract = {Congenital solitary liver cysts are a common finding, but they are usually asymptomatic; however, symptoms occur in about 16{\%} and then require treatment. Ideally, complete or partial resection of the cyst is the treatment of choice but always implies invasive surgery. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman suffering from a massively enlarged cyst in the left liver lobe. We decided to resect the extraphepatic part of the cyst by laparoscopic surgery. The patient was discharged absolutely asymptomatic 3 days following surgery. We conclude that open resection of symptomatic congenital liver cysts should be replaced by laparoscopic removal when cysts are mostly extrahepatically located. The laparoscopic procedure combines the advantages of minimal invasive surgery with the demand for a radical effective treatment.},

@article{Buell2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current world position on laparoscopic liver surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Multiple series have reported on the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic liver surgery. Small and medium sized procedures have become commonplace in many centers, while major laparoscopic liver resections have been performed with efficacy and safety equaling open surgery in highly specialized centers. Although the field has begun to expand rapidly, no consensus meeting has been convened to discuss the evolving field of laparoscopic liver surgery. METHODS: On November 7 to 8, 2008, 45 experts in hepatobiliary surgery were invited to participate in a consensus conference convened in Louisville, KY, US. In addition, over 300 attendees were present from 5 continents. The conference was divided into sessions, with 2 moderators assigned to each, so as to stimulate discussion and highlight controversies. The format of the meeting varied from formal presentation of experiential data to expert opinion debates. Written and video records of the presentations were produced. Specific areas of discussion included indications for surgery, patient selection, surgical techniques, complications, patient safety, and surgeon training. RESULTS: The consensus conference used the terms pure laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopy, and the hybrid technique to define laparoscopic liver procedures. Currently acceptable indications for laparoscopic liver resection are patients with solitary lesions, 5 cm or less, located in liver segments 2 to 6. The laparoscopic approach to left lateral sectionectomy should be considered standard practice. Although all types of liver resection can be performed laparoscopically, major liver resections (eg, right or left hepatectomies) should be reserved for experienced surgeons facile with more advanced laparoscopic hepatic resections. Conversion should be performed for difficult resections requiring extended operating times, and for patient safety, and should be considered prudent surgical practice rather than failure. In emergent situations, efforts should be made to control bleeding before converting to a formal open approach. Utilization of a hand assist or hybrid technique may be faster, safer, and more efficacious. Indications for surgery for benign hepatic lesions should not be widened simply because the surgery can be done laparoscopically. Although data presented on colorectal metastases did not reveal an adverse effect of the laparoscopic approach on oncological outcomes in terms of margins or survival, adequacy of margins and ability to detect occult lesions are concerns. The pure laparoscopic technique of left lateral sectionectomy was used for adult to child donation while the hybrid approach has been the only one reported to date in the case of adult to adult right lobe donation. Laparoscopic liver surgery has not been tested by controlled trials for efficacy or safety. A prospective randomized trial appears to be logistically prohibitive; however, an international registry should be initiated to document the role and safety of laparoscopic liver resection. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic liver surgery is a safe and effective approach to the management of surgical liver disease in the hands of trained surgeons with experience in hepatobiliary and laparoscopic surgery. National and international societies, as well as governing boards, should become involved in the goal of establishing training standards and credentialing, to ensure consistent standards and clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To perform the first randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopic and open liver resection. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic liver resection is increasingly used for the surgical treatment of liver tumors. However, high-level evidence to conclude that laparoscopic liver resection is superior to open liver resection is lacking. METHODS Explanatory, assessor-blinded, single center, randomized superiority trial recruiting patients from Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway from February 2012 to January 2016. A total of 280 patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 133) or open (n = 147) parenchyma-sparing liver resection. The primary outcome was postoperative complications within 30 days (Accordion grade 2 or higher). Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, postoperative hospital stay, blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. RESULTS The postoperative complication rate was 19{\%} in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 31{\%} in the open-surgery group (12 percentage points difference [95{\%} confidence interval 1.67-21.8; P = 0.021]). The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic surgery (53 vs 96 hours, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas there were no differences in blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly from the laparoscopic group (0 patients) to the open group (1 patient). In a 4-month perspective, the costs were equal, whereas patients in the laparoscopic-surgery group gained 0.011 quality-adjusted life years compared to patients in the open-surgery group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing parenchyma-sparing liver resection for colorectal metastases, laparoscopic surgery was associated with significantly less postoperative complications compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic resection was cost-effective compared to open resection with a 67{\%} probability. The rate of free resection margins was the same in both groups. Our results support the continued implementation of laparoscopic liver resection.},

Other secondary endpoints were oncological outcomes, use of the Pringle maneuver, surgical time, blood losses, transfusions, hospital stay, mortality and OS, and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3, 5, and 7 years. RESULTS: LLR presented with lower global morbidity (11.5{\%} vs. 23.7{\%}, p = 0.025) but with similar severe complications. Long-term survival outcomes were similar in both groups. The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-year OS for LLR and OLR were 92.5{\%}, 71.5{\%}, 49.3{\%}, 35.6{\%} versus 93.6{\%}, 69.7{\%}, 47.4{\%}, 35.5{\%}, respectively (log-rank = 0.047, p = 0.82). DFS for LLR and OLR was 72.7{\%}, 33.5{\%}, 22.7{\%}, and 20.8{\%} versus 61.6{\%}, 27.2{\%}, 23.9{\%}, and 17.9{\%}, respectively (log-rank = 1.427, p = 0.23). LLR involved more use of the Pringle maneuver (15.5{\%} vs. 30.2{\%}, p = 0.025) and a shorter hospital stay (4 vs. 6 days, p {\textless} 0.001). There were no differences regarding surgical time, blood losses, transfusion, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with CRLM, LLR presents similar oncological outcomes with the advantages of the short-term results associated with LLR.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of worldwide literature on laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) and compare short-term outcomes against open liver resections (OLR) by meta-analyses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There are no updated pooled data since 2009 about the current status and short-term outcomes of LLR worldwide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All English language publications on LLR were screened. Descriptive worldwide data and short-term outcomes were obtained. Separate analyses were performed for minor-only and major-only resection series, and series in which minor/major resections were not differentiated. Apparent case duplications were excluded. RESULTS: A set of 463 published manuscripts were reviewed. One hundred seventy-nine single-center series were identified that accounted for 9527 LLR cases worldwide. Minor-only, major-only, and combined major-minor series were 61, 18, and 100, respectively, including 32, 8, and 43 comparative series, respectively. Of the total 9527 LLR cases reported, 6190 (65{\%}) were for malignancy and 3337 (35{\%}) were for benign indications. There were 37 deaths reported (mortality rate = 0.4{\%}). From the meta-analysis comparing case-matched LLR to OLR (N = 2900 cases), there was no increased mortality and significantly less complications, transfusions, blood loss, and hospital stay observed in LLR vs OLR. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest review of LLR available to date with over 9000 cases published. It confirms growing safety when performed in selected patients and by trained surgeons, and suggests that LLR may offer improved patient short-term outcomes compared with OLR. Improved levels of evidence, standardized reporting of outcomes, and assuring proper training are the next challenges of laparoscopic liver surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The National Clinical Database (NCD) in Japan is a nationwide registry that collects the data of more than 1,200,000 surgical cases annually from over 3,500 hospitals. Based on the NCD data, this study compared the perioperative outcomes of major laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) with those of major open liver resection (OLR) using the propensity score matching method. METHODS We collected data on 15,191 major hepatectomy cases (929 major LLR cases and 14,262 major OLR cases), and investigated the short-term outcomes in well-matched groups. RESULTS In the LLR group, 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and operative mortality were 0.9{\%}, 1.7{\%}, and 1.7{\%} respectively. The mean blood loss in the LLR group (865.4 ± 1,148.2 ml) was significantly less than in the OLR group (1,053.8 ± 1,176.6 ml), and the median postoperative hospital stay for the LLR patients (21.37 ± 19.71 days) was significantly shorter than for the OLR patients (26.25 ± 24.53 days). The complication rate in the LLR group (16.4{\%}) was significantly lower than that in the OLR group (23.5{\%}). CONCLUSION LLR in selected patients is currently safely performed as well as OLR even in patients requiring major hepatectomy, associated with less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and fewer complications.},

@article{Belli2013a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Since the inception of laparoscopic liver surgery, the left-lateral sectionectomy has become the standard of care for resection of lesions located in segments II and III. However, few centers employee laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy on a routine basis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy as a standard of care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:An international database of 1,620 laparoscopic liver resections was established and outcomes analyzed comparing the laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (L lat) to laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy (LH). All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:A total of 222 laparoscopic L lat and 82 LH were identified. The L lat group compared with LH group had a higher incidence of cirrhosis (27 vs. 21 {\%}; p = 0.003) and cancer (48 vs. 35 {\%}; p = 0.043). Tumors were larger in the LH group (7.09 ± 4.2 vs. 4.89 ± 3.1 cm; p = 0.001). Operating time for LH was longer than L lat (3.9 ± 2.3 vs. 2.9 ± 1.4 h; p {\textless} 0.001). Operative blood loss was higher in LH (306 vs. 198 cc; p = 0.003). Patient morbidity (20 vs. 18 {\%}; p = 0.765) was equivalent with a longer length of stay (7.1 ± 5.1 vs. 2.5 ± 2.3 days; p {\textless} 0.001) for LH. Patient mortality and tumor recurrence were equivalent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy is a more technically challenging and often time-consuming procedure than a left-lateral sectionectomy. This international multi-institutional confirmed that intraoperative blood loss, complications, and conversions are more than acceptable for laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy in expert hands. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates together with adequate surgical margins and long-term recurrence are not compromised by the laparoscopic approach.},

abstract = {With the improvement of laparoscopic techniques and the development of new and dedicated technologies, endoscopic liver surgery has become feasible. While wedge liver resections are performed more and more frequently, laparoscopic anatomical liver resections are still at an early stage of development and are somewhat controversial. In 1993 we initiated formal laparoscopic liver resections in selected patients. From 1993 to December 1995 20 patients underwent endoscopic formal resections: the procedures comprised six left hepatectomies, five right hepatectomies, one of which extended to the segment IV, three mesohepatectomy, five segmentectomies and one bisegmentectomy. The operation time ranged from 120 to 270 min (average 193 min). In 17 out of 20 cases a Pringle manoeuvre was performed (mean occlusion time 45 min). No intra-operative complications occurred and there were no conversions in the whole series. Average intra-operative blood loss was 397.5 mL and 35{\%} of patients required intro-operative blood transfusions. Post-operative mortality rate was 5{\%} and post-operative morbidity rate was 45{\%} (one coagulopathy with severe trombocytopaenia, six pleural effusions, one bile collection and four hematomas of the trocar sites). Such preliminary data are comparable with those of a group of 65 patients who underwent open anatomical liver resections from 1992 and 1995. Far from being a routine technique in liver surgery, the laparoscopic approach to forma liver resections may be a promising procedure in selected patients.},

@article{Gayet2007,
abstract = {Background: Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 1987, the surgical applications of laparoscopy have grown to involve most areas of general surgery. Until recently, however, major liver surgery remained outside of the scope of minimally invasive surgery. Building on advances in laparoscopic equipment, techniques, and ongoing experience in hepatic surgery, major liver resection has been performed laparoscopically in some select centers. At our institute, a safe and standardized approach to minimally invasive major hepatectomy has been developed. This article illustrates the relevant technical maneuvers in the performance of a totally laparoscopic right hepatectomy. Common pitfalls and areas of concern are discussed. Methods: A detailed description of a standardized procedure is presented. The technique was developed from a single-institution experience of 41 laparoscopic right hepatectomies performed in a tertiary care referral center for laparoscopic digestive surgery. The prevention of bleeding and gas embolism are discussed. Conclusions: The laparoscopic right hepatectomy is feasible and safe if the appropriate expertise and equipment are available. In selected patients, this new approach can be proposed by a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic and hepatic surgery as an alternative to conventional open liver resection. {\textcopyright} 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc.

abstract = {Introduction: To compare the outcomes of pure laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy (LLH) versus open left hemihepatectomy (OLH) for benign and malignant conditions using multivariate analysis. Materials and methods: All consecutive cases of LLH and OLH between October 2007 and December 2013 in a tertiary referral hospital were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. All surgical procedures were performed by one surgeon. The LLH and OLH groups were compared in terms of patient demographics, preoperative data, clinical perioperative outcomes, and tumor characteristics in patients with malignancy. Multivariate analysis of the prognostic factors associated with severe complications was then performed. Results: The LLH group (n = 62) had a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay than the OLH group (n = 118) (9.53 ± 3.30 vs 14.88 ± 11.36 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the OLH group had {\textgreater}4 times the risk of the LLH group in terms of developing severe complications (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥III) (odds ratio 4.294, 95{\%} confidence intervals 1.165–15.832, p = 0.029). Discussion: LLH was a safe and feasible procedure for selected patients. LLH required shorter hospital stay and resulted in less operative blood loss. Multivariate analysis revealed that LLH was associated with a lower risk of severe complications compared to OLH. The authors suggest that LLH could be a reasonable treatment option for selected patients.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic hepatectomy has rapidly evolved recently; however, laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy has yet to become widely used, although anatomical hepatectomy is ideal, especially for curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and is widely accepted via open approach. This is because good-experienced skills, for example, exposing Glissonean pedicles and hepatic veins on the cutting plane, are required in order to perform anatomical hepatectomy via a pure laparoscopic approach. We obtained good results for various totally laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomies using the standardized techniques. We exposed the major hepatic veins from the root side by utilizing the unique view from the caudal side in the laparoscopic approach, and moved CUSA from the root side toward the peripheral side to avoid splitting the bifurcation of the hepatic vein. We performed totally laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy for 47 patients from August, 2008, to December, 2012 (Table 1). In most types of anatomical hepatectomy, the mean blood loss was {\textless}500 ml. Conversion to open surgery was required in two patients. Postoperative complications were prolonged ascites in two, peroneal palsy in two, and biloma in one. Mortality was zero. The embedded video demonstrates totally laparoscopic right anterior sectorectomy. In conclusion, our standardized techniques make laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy more feasible.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic major hepatectomy is a common procedure that has been reported frequently; however, laparoscopic resection of centrally located tumors involving segments 4, 5, and 8 remains a technically difficult procedure because it requires 2 transection planes and dissection of numerous branches of the hepatic vein and glissonean capsule compared to hemi-hepatectomy. Here, we present 7 cases of totally laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy (Lap-RAS) and 3 cases of totally laparoscopic central bisectionectomy (Lap-CBS).Between May 2013 and January 2015, 10 totally laparoscopic anatomical resections of centrally located tumors were performed in our institution. The median age of the patients was 54.2 (38-72) years and the median ICG-R15 was 10.4 (3.9-17.4). There were 8 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 2 with metastatic colorectal cancer. All the HCC patients has the liver function impairment on the degree of Child-Pugh score A.The mean operation time was 330 +/- 92.7 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 325 +/- 234.5 mL. Only 1 patient required transfusion during surgery. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 9.5 +/- 3.4 day and postop complication was reported only 1 case that has the fluid collection at the resection margin of the liver. Mean resection margin was 8.5 +/- 6.1 mm and tumor size was 2.9 +/- 1.9 cm.Totally lap-RAS and lap-CBS are feasible operative procedures in patients with centrally located tumor of the liver and particularly in patients with limited liver function such as those with cirrhosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Good indications for laparoscopic hepatectomy are still considered to be tumors located over anterolateral segments of the liver. Tumors located over the right posterior section are considered to be difficult for laparoscopic resection. In this case series, we present our experience on laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patient data were prospectively collected. Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcome were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: During the period of May 2010-May 2014, we performed 13 laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomies. The diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma in 11 patients, of which 2 were cases of colorectal liver metastasis. Median operative time was 381 minutes, and median blood loss was 1500 mL. Significant bleeding occurred in the first 5 patients. The median size of the tumor resected was 3.7 cm, and the median resection margin was 8.7 mm. Four of the 13 patients (30.8{\%}) were cirrhotic on histological examination. There was no postoperative mortality. Median hospital stay was 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy is technically demanding. A proper inflow and outflow control is mandatory for proper anatomical resection. This surgical principle should not be compromised in the era of laparoscopic hepatectomy.},

abstract = {Early on, laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) was limited to partial resection, but major LLR is no longer rare. A difficulty scoring system is required to guide surgeons in advancing from simple to highly technical laparoscopic resections. Subjects were 90 patients who had undergone pure LLR at three medical institutions (30 patients/institution) from January 2011 to April 2014. Surgical difficulty was assessed by the operator using an index of 1-10 with the following divisions: 1-3 low difficulty, 4-6 intermediate difficulty, and 7-10 high difficulty. Weighted kappa statistic was used to calculate the concordance between the operators' and reviewers' (expert surgeon) difficulty index. Inter-rater agreement (weighted kappa statistic) between the operators' and reviewers' assessments was 0.89 with the three-level difficulty index and 0.80 with the 10-level difficulty index. A 10-level difficulty index by linear modeling based on clinical information revealed a weighted kappa statistic of 0.72 and that scored by the extent of liver resection, tumor location, tumor size, liver function, and tumor proximity to major vessels revealed a weighted kappa statistic of 0.68. We proposed a new scoring system to predict difficulty of various LLRs preoperatively. The calculated score well reflected difficulty.},

@article{Ikeda2014,
abstract = {Background: Hepatic tumors in the lower edge and lateral segments are commonly treated by laparoscopic liver resection. Tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments are often large and locally invasive, and resection is associated with a higher risk of insufficient surgical margins, massive intraoperative bleeding, and breaching of the tumor. Laparoscopic surgery for such tumors often involves major hepatectomy, including resection of a large volume of normal liver tissue. We developed a novel method of laparoscopic resection of tumors in these segments with the patient in the semiprone position, using a dual-handling technique with an intercostal transthoracic port. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and usefulness of our technique. Methods: Of 160 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection at our center from June 2008 to May 2013, we retrospectively reviewed those with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments. Patients were placed supine or semilateral during surgery until January 2010 and semiprone from February 2010. Results: Before the introduction of the semiprone position in February 2010, a total of 7 of 40 patients (17.5{\%}) with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments underwent laparoscopic liver resection, and after introduction of the semiprone position, 69 of 120 patients (57.5{\%}) with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments underwent laparoscopic liver resection (P {\textless} 0.001). There were no conversions to open surgery, reoperations, or deaths. The semiprone group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who underwent partial resection or segmentectomy of S7 or S8, lower intraoperative blood loss, and shorter hospital stay than the supine group (all P {\textless} 0.05). Postoperative complication rates were similar between groups. Conclusions: Laparoscopic liver resection in the semiprone position is safe and increases the number of patients who can be treated by laparoscopic surgery without increasing the frequency of major hepatectomy. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {Background: The advantages of laparoscopic liver resection become more obvious as evidence on its long-term outcome has emerged. Compared to open resection, there is no difference in term of overall survival. Many reports showed that the hospital stay was shorter and blood loss was less when laparoscopic hepatectomy was used. However, laparoscopic approach for caudate lobe resection remains a challenging procedure. The close proximity to inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic vein make this procedure extra difficult. This paper will demonstrate the use of pure laparoscopic approach for a patient with caudate lobe liver metastasis. Haemostasis by intracorporal suturing is safely performed when bleeding is encountered from the IVC. Method: The patient was a 54-year-old lady who had carcinoma of the rectum with laparoscopic anterior resection performed. She was found to have a 2 cm lesion in the left caudate lobe of the liver on follow-up. Her platelet count was only 120×109/L. Pure laparoscopic resection of the caudate lobe was performed as shown in the video. Results: The operation last for 180 minutes. Blood loss was 220 mL and no blood transfusion was required. She resumed diet on the next day and was discharged 3 days after the operation. Histopathological examination showed 2 cm colorectal liver metastasis with a clear margin. Contrast CT scan performed 1 year after the operation showed no recurrence of the disease. Conclusions: Laparoscopic approach for caudate lobe resection is a feasible option. It can be performed to patients in center by surgeons with experience in both hepatobiliary and laparoscopic skills.},

@article{Araki2018,
abstract = {Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is now performed widely, but is difficult to accomplish in some anatomical locations, such as the posterosuperior segments (S7 and S8) and caudate lobe (S1). An international survey revealed that lesions in these locations are less frequently indicated for LLR than those in other segments. Recent reports from experienced centers document several case series and present technical tips for treating such lesions. The lateral approach using intercostal (transdiaphragmatic) trocars was reported to be useful for lesions in the posterosuperior segments with a semi- to full-decubitus position. The thoracoscopic approach was also reported to be useful for lesions just under the diaphragm dome, but the tumor location and patient selection should be considered carefully because pneumoperitoneum pressure and Pringle's maneuver cannot be applied. Several case series have described the feasibility of LLR for caudate lobe lesions, with similar operative outcomes to lesions in the posterosuperior segments, but this demands technical expertise. The caudal view of laparoscopy is advantageous for approaching the caudate lobe. We conducted a systematic review to clarify the feasibility of LLR for difficult lesions and discuss its current and future status.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumour thrombus (TT) in the inferior vena cava (IVC) or right atrium (RA) is a rare advanced disease state with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to examine survival after surgical resection. METHODS Patients with HCC and TT of either the IVC or RA, who underwent liver resection between February 1997 and July 2017, were included. Their short- and long-term outcomes and surgical details were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients were included; 16 patients had TT in the IVC below the diaphragm, eight had TT in the IVC above the diaphragm, and 13 had TT entering the RA. Twelve patients had advanced portal vein TT (portal vein invasion (Vp) greater than Vp3 and Vp4), ten had bilobar disease, and 12 had extrahepatic disease. There were no in-hospital deaths, although two patients died within 90 days. Median survival did not differ between patients who had resection with curative intent (18{\textperiodcentered}7 months) and those with residual tumour in the lung only (20{\textperiodcentered}7 months), but survival was poor for patients with residual tumour in the liver (8{\textperiodcentered}3 months). CONCLUSION Liver resection with thrombectomy for advanced HCC with TT in the IVC or RA is safe and feasible, leading to moderate survival.

Among them, KRAS has been investigated in the present study. Methods: Patients who underwent curative surgery for CLM between 2008 and 2016 were identified. R0, R1vasc and parenchymal R1 (R1par; tumor exposure once dissected from the parenchyma) resections with known KRAS status were analyzed. Results: Of 1000 resection areas in 340 patients, 654 (65{\%}) R0, 98 (10{\%}) R1vasc and 248 (25{\%}) R1par. In mutated KRAS (mKRAS), local recurrence (LR) was similar between R0 and R1vasc (per-patient 4,8{\%} vs. 2{\%}, p = 0.628; per-area 2,1{\%} vs. 1,9{\%}, p = 0.940), while higher in R1par (per-patient 25,4{\%} and per-area 19,5{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001 for both). In wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS), R0 had less LR compared to R1vasc (per-patient 7,6{\%} vs 14,6{\%}, p = 0.335; per-area 3,1{\%} vs 13,3{\%}, p = 0.012) and R1par (per-patient 18,3{\%}, p = 0.060; per-area 9,9{\%}, p = 0.013). KRAS did not impact LR in R0 (per-patient 7,6{\%} vs. 4,8{\%}, p = 0.491; per-area 3,1{\%} vs. 2,1{\%}, p = 0.555), while wtKRAS R1par had less LR compared to mKRAS R1par (per-patient 18,3{\%} vs 25,4{\%}, p = 0.404; per-area 9,9{\%} vs 19,5{\%}, p = 0.048). Inversely, LR was increased in wtKRAS R1vasc compared to mKRAS R1vasc (per-patient 14,6{\%} vs 2{\%}, p = 0.043; per-area 13,3{\%} vs 1,9{\%}, p = 0.046). Conclusion: KRAS status does not impact LR risk in R0 resection. Inversely, R1vasc vs R1par LR risk is reduced in mKRAS, and increased in wtKRAS. If confirmed these results are of note.},

abstract = {The best known treatment of the colorectal liver metastasis is the complete surgical excision with clean surgical margins. However, liver resections sometimes cannot appear technically feasible due to the high number of metastases in the liver, in cases of recurrent resections or invasion of the tumors to the major vascular structures or neighboring organs. Here, we presented a colorectal recurrent liver metastasis invading the retrohepatic vena cava, right adrenal gland, and right diaphragm. En masse resection of the tumor with caudate hepatectomy combined with vena cava resection and surrounding adrenal and diaphragm resections was accomplished. Caval reconstruction was done by a 5 cm in length cryopreserved vena cava homograft under isolated caval clamping. Postoperative period was uneventful and she was discharged on day 11. As a conclusion, combined liver and vena cava resection for a recurrent colorectal liver metastasis is a feasible procedure even with additional neighboring organ resections. Isolated vena cava occlusion with the preservation of the hepatic blood flow may decrease the risk of liver injury in case of previous chemotherapy for liver metastasis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Japan. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma involving all major hepatic veins was diagnosed in a 62-year-old man. Multidetector-row computed tomography showed a massive tumor occupying segments 2–5, 7, and 8, with invasion of all major hepatic veins, although the inferior right hepatic vein, draining the venous flow of segment 6, was clearly visualized. Therefore, we planned an extended left trisectionectomy, involving resection of segments 1–5, 7, and 8, with extrahepatic bile duct resection and concomitant resection of all major hepatic veins. We performed portal vein embolization of the right anterior portal branch and the portal branch of segment 7 to identify the demarcation between segments 6 and 7 on the surface of the right lobe. We were able to divide the hepatic parenchyma between segments 6 and 7 and the planned surgery was accomplished, with repositioning of the confluence of the inferior right hepatic vein to prevent outflow blockage. The histological findings were pT3N0M0, Grade2, Stage III, and R0 resection, according to the UICC classification (seventh edition). Although remnant liver metastases were detected 75 months after surgery, the patient is still alive and being treated with chemotherapy, 88 months after surgery. We report this case to demonstrate how using portal vein embolization to identify the hepatic segment helps accomplish extended hepatectomy preserving only one segment and that R0 resection by extended hepatectomy with concomitant resection of all hepatic veins can achieve a satisfactory outcome.},

abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic versus open hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection reduces morbidity without a compromise in oncologic safety.1–4 Moreover, in the subgroup of cirrhotic patients, a decreased risk of prolonged postoperative ascites and liver decompensation has been reported.5–7 Methods: A 54-year-old homeless, deaf male with chronic alcoholism, hepatitis C, and advanced cirrhosis was referred with a caudate tumor from a critical access hospital. Imaging showed a 3.6-cm HCC in the caudate lobe compressing the inferior vena cava (IVC). With the patient in reversed, modified French position, the liver was mobilized, and the hepatocaval space dissected. Portal and short hepatic vein branches were individually controlled, and the caudate lobe was dissected off the IVC. At the superior portion of the Spiegel process, the tumor was inseparable from the IVC, necessitating en bloc segment 1 with partial IVC resection. The IVC was reconstructed laparoscopically following a preplanned approach. The pathology report confirmed R0 resection of a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma without microvascular or perineural invasion (pT1bN0M0). Conclusion: Laparoscopic caudate lobectomy for cirrhotic patients with partial IVC resection is technically demanding. It therefore requires a strategic and preplanned approach with dedicated instrumentation and laparoscopic skills available. Although the caudal view along the axis of the IVC facilitates dissection, a laparoscopic approach necessitates particular attention to central venous pressure management (intravenous fluid and respiratory tidal volume), meticulous control of portal and short hepatic vein branches, and availability of specialty laparoscopic instrumentation to ensure procedural safety.},

There is virtually no report of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for HCC which involves the main trunk of major hepatic veins. We present our method for the procedure. We experienced 6 cases: 3 right anterior, 2 left medial, and 1 right posterior extended sectionectomies with major hepatic vein resection; tumor sizes are within 40-75 (median: 60) mm.

There was no mortality and 1 patient developed postoperative pleural effusion. For these procedures, we propose that the steps listed below are useful, taking advantages of the laparoscopy-specific view. (1) The Glissonian pedicle of the section is encircled and clamped. (2) Liver transection on the ischemic line is performed in the caudal to cranial direction. (3) During transection, the clamped Glissonian pedicle and the peripheral part of hepatic vein are divided. (4) The root of hepatic vein is divided in the good view from caudal and dorsal direction.},

abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic right hepatectomy has become a standard procedure for laparoscopic resection in specialized centers;1–6 however, tumor involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is still considered a contraindication. Here, we describe a safe technique of totally laparoscopic extended right hepatectomy to segment 1 combined with IVC resection using an anterior approach.
Methods: We performed 61 totally laparoscopic right hepatectomies by an anterior approach between January 2009 and April 2014. The video illustrates this procedure in a 58-year-old female with bilateral colorectal liver metastases involving the right-anterior wall of the retrohepatic IVC. Right hepatectomy was performed by initial hilar dissection and ligation of vascular inflow followed by division of the hepatic parenchyma with en-bloc segmentectomy 1, to expose the left side of the retrohepatic IVC. The right hepatic vein was divided using an endoscopic vascular stapler. As the involved portion of IVC could be isolated with the application of a single vascular clamp, the right IVC wall was divided using an endoscopic stapler. Thereafter, posterior mobilization of the right liver was performed.
Results: The surgical duration was 270 min and blood loss was 50 mL. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 9 days after surgery. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a colorectal metastasis with tumor-free margin.
Conclusion: We devised a secure procedure to perform totally laparoscopic right hepatectomy combined with IVC resection using an anterior approach; this may be a safe and useful technique to perform laparoscopic right hepatectomy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) has been developed gradually with the advances in surgical laparoscopic techniques. It is technically challenging to perform LPD with portal vein resection and reconstruction. CASE SUMMARY A 71-year-old female patient was diagnosed with distal cholangiocarcinoma. After preoperative examination and rigorous preoperative preparation, the patient underwent LPD using 3D laparoscopy on July 17, 2018. During the surgery, we found that the tumor invaded the right wall of the portal vein; thus, pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with partial portal vein wall resection was performed. The defect of the portal vein wall was approximately 2.5 cm × 1.0 cm. The hepatic ligamentum teres was excised by laparoscopy and then recanalized in vitro. Following recanalization, the hepatic ligamentum teres was cut longitudinally and then trimmed into vascular patches that were then used to reconstruct the defect of the portal vein through 3D laparoscopy. The operative time was 560 min, and intraoperative blood loss was 100 mL. The duration of the blood occlusion time was 63 min. No blood transfusion was required. The patient underwent enhanced recovery after surgery procedures after the operation. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 11. Follow-up for 6 months after discharge showed no stenosis of the portal vein and good patency of blood flow. CONCLUSION It is safe and feasible to use the hepatic ligamentum teres patch to repair portal vein in LPD. However, the long-term patency of this technique for venous reconstruction requires further investigation.},

abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy with venous reconstruction is not commonly performed due to its technical challenges. In this video, we focus on the technical aspects for how to perform this procedure safely. Methods: In a 69-year-old female with jaundice and diarrhea, a computed tomography scan showed a mass in the head of the pancreas, with a 180-degree involvement of the superior mesenteric vein. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stenting was performed together with endoscopic ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration. Biopsy showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with reduction of the vein involvement to 90 degrees. The mass invaded the right lateral aspect of the superior mesenteric vein–portal vein confluence. As a result, this portion of the vein was removed en bloc with the specimen. The vascular defect was repaired using two running sutures. Once the choledocojejunostomy and intussuscepted pancreatico-gastric anastomosis were completed, the specimen was removed via a small subxiphoid incision. Results: Operative time was 6 h and 30 min, blood loss was 50 mL, and hospital stay was 12 days. Histopathological examination was ypT3 N1 (1 of 18 lymph nodes was positive). All margins were negative. Conclusion: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular reconstruction can be performed safely in selected cases of pancreatic head cancer with vein involvement. Advanced laparoscopic skills are necessary to complete such procedures safely.},

The aim of the present study was to describe the technique and outcomes of patients undergoing TLPD with major venous resection. Methods: Retrospective review of all consecutive patients undergoing TLPD and major venous resection from July 2007 to December 2010 was performed. Patient demographics and peri-operative outcomes were retrieved. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with range. Results: Out of 129 patients undergoing TLPD, major venous resection was performed in 11 patients with a mean age of 71 years. Median operative time and blood loss was 413 (301-666) min and 500 (75-2800) ml, respectively. Venous resection included tangential (n= 10) and segmental resection (n= 1). Venous reconstruction included patch (n= 4), suture (n= 4), stapled (n= 2) and a left renal vein interposition graft (n= 1). Median mesoportal clamp time was 35 (10-82) min. There was no 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Post-operative imaging was available in 10 patients with 100{\%} patency at the venous reconstruction site.

abstract = {Since the introduction of Da Vinci robotic surgery, more and more complicated surgeries can now be performed robotically, yet there have been very few on robotic hepatectomy, especially when billiary reconstruction is involved. The video shows our initial experience with an anatomic hepatectomy using Da Vinci surgical robot. In this case, we also conducted billiary reconstruction due to the anatomic abnormality of bile duct, while applying the choledochoscopy. The preoperative diagnosis is primary liver carcinoma, tumor thrombi in bile duct, and hepatitis B. First, the gallbladder was resected, and cystic artery and duct were identified. After opening of the common bile duct above the junction, the choledochoscopy was performed. Tumor thrombi were found in common bile duct and left hepatic duct, and they were all removed. Left branches hepatic artery and portal vein were dissected, ligated, and divided. Thrombi in the left hepatic duct were removed also. After marking the cutting line along the ischemic boarder, liver parenchyma was transected using robotic harmonic scalpel. Branches of ducts were encountered and managed by either direct coagulating or dividing after clipping. The left hepatic vein was visualized, exposed, and divided during hepatectomy. Two T tubes were placed into common hepatic duct and the proximal cutting end of right anterior bile duct which was found to join the left hepatic duct, respectively. The operation went on successfully. The operation time was 410 minutes, the blood loss was 200 mL. The pathologic diagnosis was introductal papillary adenocarcinoma of left hepatic duct. The patient went on well postoperatively and was followed up for 22 months till now. Postoperative computed tomography examination showed no recurrence. Da Vinci-assisted robotic hepatectomy can be performed safely in the hands of experienced hepatobilliary surgeons, and choledochoscopy can be combined for bile duct exploration. With the advantages of Da Vinci robot system, complicated billiary reconstruction can be performed (http://links.lww.com/SLE/A74).},

abstract = {Background: Bile duct injuries after cholecystectomy remain a major concern because their incidence has not changed through the years despite technical advances. This video presents a robotic left hepatectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy as a treatment for a complex bile duct injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: A 52-year-old man underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at another institution 8 years previously, which resulted in a bile duct injury. His postoperative period was complicated by jaundice and cholangitis. He was treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and multiple endoprostheses for 3 years, after which the endoprostheses were removed, and he was sent to the authors' institution. Computed tomography showed that the left liver had signs of disturbed perfusion and dilation of the left intrahepatic bile duct. The patient was asymptomatic and refused any further attempt at surgical correction of the lesion. He was accompanied for 5 years. Magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive atrophy of the left liver. Finally, 3 months before this writing, he presented with intermittent episodes of cholangitis. A multidisciplinary team decided to perform left hepatectomy with Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy via a robotic approach. The left liver was atrophied, and left hepatectomy was performed. Fluorescence imaging was used to identify the right bile duct. At opening of the right bile duct, small stones were found and removed. Antecolic Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy then was performed. Results: The operative time was 335 min. Recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4. Conclusions: Robotic repair of bile duct injuries is feasible and safe, even when liver resection is necessary. This video may help oncologic surgeons to perform this complex procedure.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy remain a surgical challenge despite the recent advances in minimally invasive surgery. A robotic surgical system has been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of the traditional laparoscopic approach. However, techniques of robotic hepatectomy have not been well described, and a description of robotic major hepatectomy with bilioenteric anastomosis can be found only in two previous reports. Here, we report a 33-year-old man with a history of choledochocyst resection. The patient experienced repeat cholangitis with left hepatolithiasis during follow-up. Robotic left hepatectomy and revision of hepaticojejunostomy were performed smoothly. The patient recovered uneventfully and remained symptoms-free at a follow-up of 20 months. The robotic approach is beneficial in the fine dissection of the hepatic hilum and revision of hepaticojejunostomy in this particular patient.

The patient underwent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy and right hemihepatectomy. Child's approach was used for the reconstruction. The patient recovered well with bile leakage from the 2nd postoperative day and was discharged on the 16th postoperative day with a drainage tube in place which was removed 2 wk after discharge. Postoperative pathology revealed a well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma and the margin of liver parenchyma, pancreas and stomach was negative for metastases.

abstract = {An American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA)-sponsored consensus meeting of expert panellists met on 15 January 2014 to review current evidence on the management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in order to establish practice guidelines and to agree on consensus statements. The treatment of ICC requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to optimize survival. Biopsy is not necessary if the surgeon suspects ICC and is planning curative resection, although biopsy should be obtained before systemic or locoregional therapies are initiated. Assessment of resectability is best accomplished using cross-sectional imaging [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], but the role of positron emission tomography (PET) is unclear. Resectability in ICC is defined by the ability to completely remove the disease while leaving an adequate liver remnant. Extrahepatic disease, multiple bilobar or multicentric tumours, and lymph node metastases beyond the primary echelon are contraindications to resection. Regional lymphadenectomy should be considered a standard part of surgical therapy. In patients with high-risk features, the routine use of diagnostic laparoscopy is recommended. The preoperative diagnosis of combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) by imaging studies is extremely difficult. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, but survival is worse than in HCC alone. There are no adequately powered, randomized Phase III trials that can provide definitive recommendations for adjuvant therapy for ICC. Patients with high-risk features (lymphovascular invasion, multicentricity or satellitosis, large tumours) should be encouraged to enrol in clinical trials and to consider adjuvant therapy. Cisplatin plus gemcitabine represents the standard-of-care, front-line systemic therapy for metastatic ICC. Genomic analyses of biliary cancers support the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.},

Methods: A literature search with a date range of January 2000 to January 2018 was performed to identify studies comparing lymph node dissection (LND+) with non-lymph node dissection (LND-) for patients with ICC. The LND + group was further divided into positive (LND + N+) and negative (LND + N-) lymph node status groups based on pathological analysis. Results: 13 studies including 1377 patients were eligible. There were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) (HR 1.13, 95{\%} CI 0.94–1.36; P = 0.20), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.23, 95{\%} CI 0.94–1.60; P = 0.13), or recurrence (OR 1.39, 95{\%} CI 0.90–2.15; P = 0.14) between LND + group and LND-group. Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in the LND + group (OR 2.67, 95{\%} CI 1.74–4.10; P {\textless} 0.001). A subset analysis showed that OS was similar between LND + N- and LND-groups (HR 1.13, 95{\%} CI 0.82–1.56; P = 0.450). However when comparing, OS of the LND-group to the LND+N+ group there was a significant increase in OS for the LND-group (HR 3.26, 95{\%} CI 1.85–5.76; P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: LND does not seem to positively affect overall survival and is associated with increased post-operative morbidity.},

abstract = {Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most prevalent primary liver neoplasm after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), corresponding to 10{\%} to 15{\%} of cases. Pathologies that cause chronic biliary inflammation and bile stasis are known predisposing factors for development of ICC. The incidence and cancer-related mortality of ICC is increasing worldwide. Most patients remain asymptomatic until advance stage, commonly presenting with a liver mass incidentally diagnosed. The only potentially curative treatment available for ICC is surgical resection. The prognosis is dismal for unresectable cases. The principle of the surgical approach is a margin negative hepatic resection with preservation of adequate liver remnant. Regional lymphadenectomy is recommended at time of hepatectomy due to the massive impact on outcomes caused by lymph node (LN) metastasis. Multicentric disease, tumor size, margin status and tumor differentiation are also important prognostic factors. Staging laparoscopy is warranted in high-risk patients to avoid unnecessary laparotomy. Exceedingly complex surgical procedures, such as major vascular, extrahepatic bile ducts and visceral resections, ex vivo hepatectomy and autotransplantation, should be implemented in properly selected patients to achieve negative margins. Neoadjuvant therapy may be used in initially unresectable lesions in order to downstage and allow resection. Despite optimal surgical management, recurrence is frustratingly high. Adjuvant chemotherapy with radiation associated with locoregional treatments should be considered in cases with unfavorable prognostic factors. Selected patients may undergo re-resection of tumor recurrence. Despite the historically poor outcomes of liver transplantation for ICC, highly selected patients with unresectable disease, especially those with adequate response to neoadjuvant therapy, may be offered transplant. In this article, we reviewed the current literature in order to highlight the most recent advances and recommendations for the surgical treatment of this aggressive malignancy.},

@article{Colasanti2017,
abstract = {Abstract Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is the second most common type of primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma. Surgical resection is considered the only curative treatment for CC. In general, laparoscopic liver surgery (LLS) is associated with improved short-term outcomes without compromising the long-term oncological outcome. However, the role of LLS in the treatment of CC is not yet well established. In addition, CC may arise in any tract of the biliary tree, thus requiring different types of treatment, including pancreatectomies and extrahepatic bile duct resections. This review presents and discusses the state of the art in the laparoscopic and robotic surgical treatment of all types of CC. An electronic search was performed to identify all studies dealing with laparoscopic or robotic surgery and cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopic resection in patients with intrahepatic CC (ICC) is feasible and safe. Regarding oncologic adequacy, as R0 resections, depth of margins, and long-term overall and disease-free survival, laparoscopy is comparable to open procedures for ICC. An adequate patient selection is required to obtain optimal results. Use of laparoscopy in perihilar CC (PHC) has not gained popularity. Further studies are still needed to confirm the benefit of this approach over conventional surgery for PHC. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for distal CC (DCC) represents one of the most advanced abdominal operations owing to the necessity of a complex dissection and reconstruction and has also had small widespread so far. Minimally invasive surgery seems feasible and safe especially for ICC. Laparoscopy for PHC is technically challenging notably for the caudate lobectomy. Not least as for the LLR, the robotic approach for DCC appears technically achievable in selected patients.},

@article{Ratti2016a,
abstract = {Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is still a relatively uncommon indication for laparoscopic surgery because of technical challenges related to the frequent need for major hepatectomies and the necessity to perform formal regional lymphadenectomy. The aim of the present case-matched study was to compare laparoscopic and open resections for ICC. Methods: In a case-matched retrospective analysis, 20 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic resection for ICC (LPS group) were compared with 60 of 83 patients who had undergone open surgery (open group) in the same institution. The groups were matched in a ratio of 1:3 using propensity scores based on covariates representing relevant patient characteristics and severity of disease. The main endpoints were short- and long-term outcomes and impact and adequacy of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy. Results: The groups were well matched in terms of patient and disease characteristics. The laparoscopic approach resulted in less blood loss (200 vs. 350 mL, p = 0.040) despite less extensive use of the Pringle maneuver. There was no difference in perioperative morbidity and mortality rates; however, the laparoscopic approach was associated with faster functional recovery (median 3 vs. 4 days, p = 0.050). After a mean follow-up of 39 months, disease-free and overall survivals were 33 and 51 months, respectively, for the LPS and 36 and 63, respectively, for the open group (p ns). The number of harvested nodes was comparable between groups. Conclusions: Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic resection of ICC is feasible and safe, providing short-term benefits without negatively affecting oncologic adequacy in terms of rate of R0 resections, depth of margins, and long-term overall and disease-free survivals. Laparoscopic regional lymphadenectomy is technically possible but should be the object of future focused studies.},

abstract = {Background: Associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) represents a new surgical technique for the resection of advanced hepatic malignancies with predicted insufficient future liver remnant. In some patients, ALPPS can be associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been proposed in combination with ALPPS with the intent to minimize this risk. We systematically evaluated the outcomes of MIS-ALPPS cases to compare the relative outcomes of open ALPPS versus MIS-ALPPS. Methods: A systematic review was done in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Search terms utilized included the following: (“ALPPS”[Title/Abstract] OR “associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy”[Title/Abstract] OR “in situ split”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“minimally invasive”[Title/Abstract] OR “laparoscopic”[Title/Abstract] OR “robotic”[Title/Abstract]). Results: Fifteen articles were identified, with a total of 27 patients reported. Colorectal metastatic disease was the most commonly observed indication for MIS-ALPPS (66.7{\%}), followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (25.9{\%}). Time passed from the first to the second stage ranged 7–30 days. MIS-ALPPS patients did not experience procedure failures between the first and second stages. Only four (15.4{\%}) subjects had a grade IIIb complication. No perioperative mortality after the first or second stage was reported. Compared with open ALPPS, MIS-ALPPS demonstrated better results. Hospital stay duration ranged 8–33 days with a follow-up ranging 1–20 months. Conclusions: MIS-ALPPS appears to be safe, with potentially lower morbidities and mortalities relative to open patients. The present results should be considered with caution. A limited number of articles exist on this topic. Furthermore, selection biases exist when comparing open versus MIS-ALPPS data. Registry studies are needed to better define the outcomes of patients undergoing MIS-ALPPS.},

abstract = {Background: Because cadaveric organ donors are in short supply, living donors are increasingly being used in transplantations. We have developed a safe and reproducible method for laparoscopic liver resection. Methods: Left hepatic lobectomy (resection of segments 2 and 3) was done by laparoscopy in one woman aged 27 years and one man aged 31 years. The grafts were prepared under laparoscopy, without any vascular clamping, and were externalised through a suprapubic Pfannenstiel incision. Both grafts were transplanted conventionally to the patients' respective sons, who were both aged 1 year and had biliary atresia. Findings: Donor operations lasted 7 h for the woman and 6 h for the man, and warm ischaemia times were 4 and 10 min, respectively. Blood loss was 150 and 450 mL, respectively, and no transfusions were required. Neither patient had complications during or after sugery; and hospital stay was 7 and 5 days, respectively. Both recipients are alive and have excellent graft function. Interpretation: We have shown the feasibility of laparoscopic living donor hepatectomy from parent to child. If the safety and feasbility of this procedure can be shown in larger series, laparoscopic donor left lobectomy could become a new option for paediatric living donor liver transplantation.},

abstract = {Background: The present study was undertaken to determine whether laparoscopic live donor left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) in paediatric liver transplantation is a feasible, safe and reproducible procedure, compared with open live donor left lateral sectionectomy (OLS). Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all consecutive live donor procedures for paediatric liver transplantation performed between May 2008 and October 2009. All live donor hepatectomies were carried out by a single surgeon. Results: A total of 26 live donor procedures for paediatric liver transplantation were performed, of which 11 were LLS and 11 OLS; four left hepatectomies were excluded. The LLS group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (mean(s.d.) 6{\textperiodcentered}9(0{\textperiodcentered} 3) versus 9{\textperiodcentered}8(0{\textperiodcentered}9) days; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}001) and time to oral diet (2{\textperiodcentered}1(0{\textperiodcentered}3) versus 2{\textperiodcentered}7(0{\textperiodcentered}4) days; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}012). Duration of operation, blood loss, warm ischaemia time and out-of-pocket medical costs were comparable between groups. There was no death in either donor group and only one complication, a wound seroma, in the OLS group. Conclusion: LLS seemed to be a safe, feasible and reproducible procedure, and was associated with reduced hospital stay. {\textcopyright} 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: This reviewassesses the current status of laparoscopic liver resec- tion. Background: The trend in laparoscopic liver resection has been moving from limited resections toward major hepatectomy. The surgical techniques for laparoscopic major hepatectomy include pure laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic, and laparoscopy-assisted methods. We performed a literature search and systematic review to assess the current status of laparoscopic ma- jor hepatectomy. Methods: Our literature review was conducted in Medline using the key- words “laparoscopy” or “laparoscopic” combined with “liver resection” or “hepatectomy.” Articles written in English containing more than 10 cases of laparoscopic major hepatectomy were selected. Results and Conclusions: Twenty-nine articles were selected for this re- view. The laparoscopicmajor hepatectomies achieved similar patient and eco- nomic outcomes comparedwith open liver resections in selected (noncirrhotic) patients. Surgeon experience with the techniques affected the results; thus, a learning period is mandatory. Of these 3 techniques, the pure laparoscopic method is suitable for experienced surgeons to achieve better cosmetic out- comes, whereas the hand-assisted laparoscopic method was associated with better perioperative outcomes; the laparoscopy-assisted method is used by sur- geons for unique resections such as resection of cirrhotic livers, laparoscopic resection of tumors in unfavorable locations, and living donor hepatectomies. In addition, the laparoscopicmajor hepatectomy-specific, long-termoncologic outcomes remain to be addressed in future publications.},

abstract = {Background: The critical shortage of deceased organ donors has led to live-donor hepatectomy as an alternative donor option for transplantation. Although laparoscopic hepatectomy has been well described for management of liver tumors and can be performed safely, few studies have examined early recipient allograft outcomes after laparoscopic live-donor hepatectomy. We describe our initial experience with laparoscopic-assisted and minimal-access donor hepatectomy and its potential as a safe alternative with graft function comparable with open resection in live-donor liver transplantation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of our past 30 successive live-donor transplants between 2005 and 2009. Fifteen allografts were procured by standard open live-donor (OLD) hepatectomy, and 15 by laparoscopic-assisted (LALD) or minimal-access (MA) live-donor hepatectomy. Left lateral segment grafts were subcategorized and analyzed further. Results: Mean donor age, sex, and liver anatomy were comparable between donor groups. Early graft function as measured by peak total bilirubin level, aspartate aminotransferase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and international normalized ratio on postoperative days 2, 7, 30, and 90 were similar between groups, although the international normalized ratio was slightly more increased on postoperative day 7 in LALD grafts (1.75 ± .45 vs 1.28 ± .16; P = .02). Perioperative allograft biliary (2 of 15 vs 0 of 15; P = .48) and vascular (3 of 15 vs 1 of 15; P = .6) complication rates also were comparable between OLD and LALD/MA grafts. One-year graft and patient survival for LALD/MA was 100{\%} compared with 93{\%} for OLD. Conclusions: Our experience shows that LALD or MA live-donor hepatectomy is a safe procedure and produces early graft function comparable with standard OLD hepatectomy. Multicenter, larger-volume experience will determine the widespread application of this technique. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The recent interest in a minimally invasive approach to liver surgery has raised the possibility of applying these techniques to living donor right lobectomy. Herein, we report the first case of a laparoscopic, hand-assisted living donor right hepatic lobectomy. We describe the technical aspects of the procedure, and discuss the rationale for considering this option. We propose that the procedure, as described, did not increase the operative risks of the procedure; instead, it decreased potential morbidity.

A 50-year-old female volunteered for living donation to her sister who suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis. The volume of the planned hepatic graft (segments 5-8) was 620 cm(3) , representing 56{\%} of her entire liver. Five ports were used in the donor to perform the operative procedure. The right hepatic artery and portal vein were isolated. Parenchymal division was performed using an ultrasonic dissector, bipolar coagulation and clips for hemostasis. Cholangiography was performed and the right bile duct was cut at the level of a marker thread. The right liver graft was placed in a bag and removed through a 10-cm suprapubic incision. The veins of segments 5 and 8 were recanalized and the graft was transplanted in the recipient. The postoperative course was uneventful for both the donor and recipient. This case offers evidence that the right liver can be procured via a total laparoscopic approach. This technique may allow for an early rehabilitation for the living donor.},

However, the clinical outcomes of recipients at 1-year follow-up have never been accurately compared. We aimed to compare 1-year outcomes of recipients of living donor right liver transplantation (LRLT) using pure LLDRH and OLDRH. From May 2013 to May 2017, 197 consecutive recipients underwent LRLT. Donor hepatectomies were performed either by OLDRH (n = 127) or pure LLDRH (n = 70). After propensity score matching, 53 recipients were included in each group for analysis. The clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up were compared between the 2 groups. The primary outcome was recipient death or graft failure during the 1-year follow-up period. In the propensity-matched analysis, the incidence of death or graft failure during the 1-year follow-up period was not different between the 2 groups (3.8{\%} versus 5.7{\%}; odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.24-8.95; P = 0.69). However, the composite of Clavien-Dindo 3b-5 complications was more frequent in the pure LLDRH group (OR, 2.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.15-5.96; P = 0.02). In conclusion, although pure LLDRH affords a comparable incidence of fatal complications in recipients, operative complications may increase at the beginning of the program. The safety of the recipients should be confirmed to accept pure LLDRH as a feasible option.},

abstract = {Left lateral sectionectomy for donor hepatectomy is a well-established alternative to deceased donor pediatric liver transplantation. However, very little is available on the laparoscopic approach (laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy [L-LLS]). With the aim to assess safety, reproducibility under proctorship, and outcomes following living donor liver transplantation in children, a comparative single-center series using propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate open left lateral sectionectomy (O-LLS) versus L-LLS was carried out in a relatively short time period in a high-volume pediatric transplant center. A retrospective, observational, single-center, PSM study was conducted on 220 consecutive living donor hepatectomies from January 2011 to April 2017. The variables considered for PSM were as follows: year of operation, recipient age, indication for transplant, recipient weight, donor sex, donor age, and donor body mass index. After matching, 72 O-LLSs were fit to be compared with 72 L-LLSs. Operative time and warm ischemia time were significantly longer in L-LLSs, whereas blood loss and overall donor complication rates were significantly lower. Postoperative day 1 and 4 pain scores were significantly less in the L-LLS group (P = 0.015 and 0.003, respectively). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in L-LLS (4.6 versus 4.1 days; P = 0.014). Overall donor biliary complications were 9 (12.5{\%}) and 1 (1.4{\%}) for O-LLS and L-LLS (P = 0.022), respectively. Vascular complications occurred in 3 (4.2{\%}) children without graft loss in the laparoscopic group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall patient survival rates were 98.5{\%}, 90.9{\%}, and 90.9{\%} in the O-LLS group and in the L-LLS group 94.3{\%}, 92.7{\%}, and 86.8{\%} (P = 0.28). In conclusion, L-LLS for donor hepatectomy is a safe and reproducible technique yielding better donor perioperative outcomes with respect to the conventional approach with similar recipient outcomes.},

We did a retrospective data analysis of 54 consecutive patients operated on between May 2013 and February 2015. There were 41 right, 10 extended right, and 3 left hepatectomies.

Estimated blood loss was 300 mL (10-850 mL), and none of the patients required intraoperative transfusion. Four cases were converted to open laparotomy. The major complication rate was 16.7{\%}, and biliary complication was the most frequent cause. Patients with normal anatomy had a major complication rate of 9.3{\%} as compared with 45.5{\%} in patients with anatomic variations. All patients recovered, and there was no mortality.

However, pure laparoscopic approaches to donor hepatectomy have been limited by technical complexity and concerns over donor safety. Reducedwound donor hepatectomy, either in the form of a laparoscopic-assisted technique or by utilizing a minilaparotomy wound, i.e. , hybrid approach, has been developed to bridge the transition to pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy, offering some advantages of minimally invasive surgery. To date, pure laparoscopic donor left lateral sectionectomy has been validated for its safety and advantages and has become the standard in experienced centres. Pure laparoscopic approaches to major left and right liver donation have been reported for their technical feasibility in expert hands. Robotic-assisted donor hepatectomy also appears to be a valuable alternative to pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy, providing additional ergonomic advantages to the surgeon. Existing reports derive from centres with tremendous experience in both laparoscopic hepatectomy and donor hepatectomy. The complexity of these procedures means an arduous transition from technical feasibility to reproducibility. Donor safety is paramount in living donor liver transplantation. Careful donor selection and adopting standardized techniques allow experienced transplant surgeons to safely accumulate experience and acquire proficiency. An international prospective registry will advance the understanding for the role and safety of pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of worldwide literature on laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) and compare short-term outcomes against open liver resections (OLR) by meta-analyses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There are no updated pooled data since 2009 about the current status and short-term outcomes of LLR worldwide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All English language publications on LLR were screened. Descriptive worldwide data and short-term outcomes were obtained. Separate analyses were performed for minor-only and major-only resection series, and series in which minor/major resections were not differentiated. Apparent case duplications were excluded. RESULTS: A set of 463 published manuscripts were reviewed. One hundred seventy-nine single-center series were identified that accounted for 9527 LLR cases worldwide. Minor-only, major-only, and combined major-minor series were 61, 18, and 100, respectively, including 32, 8, and 43 comparative series, respectively. Of the total 9527 LLR cases reported, 6190 (65{\%}) were for malignancy and 3337 (35{\%}) were for benign indications. There were 37 deaths reported (mortality rate = 0.4{\%}). From the meta-analysis comparing case-matched LLR to OLR (N = 2900 cases), there was no increased mortality and significantly less complications, transfusions, blood loss, and hospital stay observed in LLR vs OLR. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest review of LLR available to date with over 9000 cases published. It confirms growing safety when performed in selected patients and by trained surgeons, and suggests that LLR may offer improved patient short-term outcomes compared with OLR. Improved levels of evidence, standardized reporting of outcomes, and assuring proper training are the next challenges of laparoscopic liver surgery.},

abstract = {We reviewed the progress made in the field of liver surgery over the past 50 years. The widespread use and improved outcomes of the hepatectomy were, primarily, due to pioneer surgeons who were responsible for technological advances and rapid improvements in the safety of the procedure in the last century. These advances included the hepatic functional evaluation used to determine the safety limit of liver resections, the introduction of intraoperative ultrasonography, and the development of innovative techniques such as portal vein embolization to increase the remnant liver volume. Cadaveric liver transplantation has been attempted since 1963. However, the clinical outcomes only began improving and becoming acceptable in the 1970s-1980s due to refinements in technology and the development of new immunosuppressants. Partial liver transplantation from living donors, which was first attempted in 1988, required further technological innovation and sophisticated perioperative management plans. Moreover, these developments allowed for further overall improvements to take place in the field of liver surgery. Since the turn of the century, advances in computation and imaging technology have made it possible for safer and more elaborate surgeries to be performed. In Japan, preoperative 3-dimensional simulation technology has been covered by health insurance since 2012 and is now widely used. An urgent need for real-time navigation tools will develop in the future. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was first used in 2007 and has led to the creation of a new surgical concept known as fluorescence navigation surgery. Laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery have solved the issue of large incisions, which used to be a major drawback of open liver surgery; however, further improvements are required in order to achieve the level of safety and accuracy observed during open liver resection when performing all minimally invasive procedures. In the near future, liver surgery will become more precise and less invasive due to substantial progress including the development of navigation surgery, cancer imaging, and minimally invasive surgery. This overview of the history of liver surgery over the past 50 years may provide useful insights for further innovation in the next 50 years.},

Liver transplantation benefits patients who have decompensated cirrhosis and one tumour smaller than 5 cm or three nodules smaller than 3 cm, but donor shortage greatly limits its applicability. This difficulty might be overcome by living donation. Most HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and receive palliative treatments, which have been assessed in the setting of 63 randomised controlled trials during the past 25 years. Meta-analysis shows that only chemoembolisation improves survival in well-selected patients with unresectable HCC.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims We aimed to develop a prognostic classification scheme with treatment guidance for Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We collected data from 3856 patients with HCC predominantly related to hepatitis B treated at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong from January 1995 through December 2008. Data on patient performance status, Child-Pugh grade, tumor status (size, number of nodules, and presence of intrahepatic vascular invasion), and presence of extrahepatic vascular invasion or metastasis were included, and randomly separated into training and test sets for analysis. Cox regression and classification and regression tree analyses were used to account for the relative effects of factors in predicting overall survival times and to classify disparate treatment decision rules, respectively; the staging system and treatment recommendation then were constructed by integration of clinical judgments. The Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) classification was compared with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification in terms of discriminatory ability and effectiveness of treatment recommendation. Results The HKLC system had significantly better ability than the BCLC system to distinguish between patients with specific overall survival times (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, approximately 0.84 vs 0.80; concordance index, 0.74 vs 0.70). More importantly, HKLC identified subsets of BCLC intermediate- and advanced-stage patients for more aggressive treatments than what were recommended by the BCLC system, which improved survival outcomes. Of BCLC-B patients classified as HKLC-II in our system, the survival benefit of radical therapies, compared with transarterial chemoembolization, was substantial (5-year survival probability, 52.1{\%} vs 18.7{\%}; P {\textless}.0001). In BCLC-C patients classified as HKLC-II, the survival benefit of radical therapies compared with systemic therapy was even more pronounced (5-year survival probability, 48.6{\%} vs 0.0{\%}; P {\textless}.0001). Conclusions We collected data from patients with HCC in Hong Kong to create a system to identify patients who are suitable for more aggressive treatment than the currently used BCLC system. The HKLC system should be validated in non-Asian patient populations and in patients with different etiologies of HCC. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the AGA Institute.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS Both hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are considered curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their economic impact still remains not determined. Aim of the present study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness (CE) of these two strategies in early stage HCC (Milan criteria). METHODS As first step, a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature of the last decade was performed. Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 3996 patients underwent resection and 4424 underwent RFA for early HCC. Data obtained from the meta-analysis were used to construct a Markov model. Costs were assessed from the health care provider perspective. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate outcomes with distribution samples of 1000 patients for each treatment arm. RESULTS In a 10-year perspective, for very early HCC (single nodule {\textless}2cm) in Child–Pugh class A patients, RFA provided similar life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy at a lower cost than resection and was the most cost-effective therapeutic strategy. For single HCCs of 3–5cm, resection provided better life-expectancy and was more cost-effective than RFA, at a willingness-to-pay above €4200 per quality-adjusted life-year. In the presence of two or three nodules ⩽3cm, life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy were very similar between the two treatments, but cost-effectiveness was again in favour of RFA. CONCLUSIONS For very early HCC and in the presence of two or three nodules ⩽3cm, RFA is more cost-effective than resection; for single larger early stage HCCs, surgical resection remains the best strategy to adopt as a result of better survival rates at an acceptable increase in cost.},

abstract = {This document presents official recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur-ring in the setting of adults with cirrhosis. Unlike pre-vious AASLD practice guidelines, the current guideline was developed in compliance with the Insti-tute of Medicine standards for trustworthy practice guidelines and uses the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. (1) Multiple systematic reviews of the litera-ture were conducted to support the recommendations in this practice guideline. An enhanced understanding of the guideline can be obtained by reading the appli-cable portions of the systematic reviews. In addition, more detailed information may be found in the associ-ated guidance document related to clinically important aspects of HCC that lacked sufficient evidence to war-rant a systematic review. The guideline focuses on a broad spectrum of clinical practice, including surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for HCC, establishing the diagnosis of HCC, and vari-ous therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC. To address other issues on HCC such as epidemiology, stag-ing, and additional aspects of diagnosis and treatment, the authors have created a new guidance document that will be published soon and is based upon the previous HCC AASLD guidelines by Bruix and Sherman. (2) KEY QUESTIONS The guideline developers from the AASLD identi-fied key questions that health care providers are faced with frequently in the evaluation and management of patients with HCC. These questions were: 1. Should adults with cirrhosis undergo surveillance for HCC? If so, which surveillance test is best? 2. Should adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC undergo diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic Abbreviations: AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Potential conflict of interest: Laura M.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Anatomic resection (AR) of the tumor-bearing portal territory has been reported to be associated with a decreased recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, because of the heterogeneity of the study populations, its oncologic advantage remains controversial. The objective of the present study was to determine the clinical advantage of AR for primary HCC, based on the data from a large prospective cohort treated under a constant surgical policy. Methods In 209 Child-Pugh class A patients with primary, solitary HCC measuring ≤5.0 cm in diameter, which was resectable either by AR or limited resection (non-AR), the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared with patients in whom complete AR was achieved and those who eventually ended up with non-AR after adjustment for the propensity scores to select AR. Advantages of AR in disease-specific survival and local recurrence were also evaluated by competing-risks regression to clarify the true oncologic impact of AR. Results The AR group showed better DFS than the non-AR group (HR, 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.99; p = 0.046), while no significant difference was observed in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.46-1.48; p = 0.511). Competing-risks regression revealed that AR significantly decreases local recurrence (HR, 0.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.30; p {\textless}0.001) and improves disease-specific survival (HR, 0.50; 95{\%} CI, 0.28-0.90; p = 0.020), while the other cause of death was highly influenced by patient age ({\textgreater}65 years) (HR, 7.51; 95{\%} CI, 2.16-26.04; p = 0.002) and not associated with AR.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The relative benefit of anatomic resection (AR) versus non-anatomic resection (NAR) of HCC remains poorly defined. We sought to evaluate the available evidence on oncologic outcomes, as well as the clinical efficacy and safety of AR versus NAR performed as the primary treatment for HCC patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane library through April 15th, 2017. Only clinical studies comparing AR versus NAR were deemed eligible. RESULTS A total of 43 studies were considered eligible (total 12,429 patients: AR, n = 6839 (55{\%}) versus NAR, n = 5590 (45{\%})). Blood loss was higher among patients undergoing AR (mean difference: +229.74 ml, 95{\%} CI: 97.09–362.38, p = 0.0007), whereas resection margin was slightly wider following AR versus NAR (mean difference: +0.29 cm, 95{\%} CI: 0.15–0.44, p {\textless} 0.0001). No difference was noted for perioperative complications (RR: 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.81–1.11, p = 0.49) and perioperative mortality (RR: 0.91, 95{\%} CI: 0.43–1.95, p = 0.82). AR was associated with a disease-free survival (DFS) benefit at 1- (HR: 0.79, 95{\%} CI: 0.68–0.92, p = 0.002), 3- (HR: 0.87, 95{\%} CI: 0.78–0.95, p = 0.004) and 5-years (HR: 0.87, 95{\%} CI: 0.82–0.93, p {\textless} 0.0001). AR also was associated with a decreased risk of death at 5-years (HR: 0.88, 95{\%} CI: 0.79–0.97, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Despite the high heterogeneity among studies, the data demonstrated that AR had comparable perioperative morbidity and mortality versus NAR. AR seemed to offer an advantage versus NAR in terms of DFS and OS among patients undergoing resection of HCC – especially among patients without cirrhosis. Thus, AR should be considered the preferred surgical option for patients with HCC when feasible.},

abstract = {Partial liver resections are the treatment of choice for patients with a malignant liver or bile duct tumor. The most frequent indications for partial liver resections are colorectal metastasis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. Liver resection is the only therapy with a chance for cure in these patients. Refinements in surgical technique and increasing experience have contributed to a reduction in perioperative morbidity and mortality in recent years. Despite these improvements, partial liver resections remain a major surgical procedure and carry the risk for excessive blood loss and a subsequent need for blood transfusion. Blood transfusions have been associated with systemic side effects, such as depression of the immune system. Several studies have suggested that perioperative blood loss or transfusions have a negative impact on postoperative outcome. However, it has been debated whether this is due to a real cause-effect relationship or merely the result of more complicated surgery. We have reviewed the literature concerning studies focusing on the relationship between blood loss and blood transfusion during liver surgery for malignant tumors and postoperative outcome. Most studies were based on a retrospective analysis of single center experiences, using uni- and multivariate statistical methods. Most studies have demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant association between blood transfusion and postoperative mortality and morbidity, especially postoperative infectious complications. The effect of blood transfusions on tumor recurrence and more long-term mortality is much less clear and evidence varies depending on the type of malignancy. The strongest indication that blood transfusion may have an impact on tumor recurrence has been found for patients with early stages of HCC. However, overall, no such effect could be demonstrated for patients undergoing partial liver resection for late stages of HCC, colorectal liver metastasis or cholangiocarcinoma.},

@article{Ishii2014,
abstract = {Liver resection is the gold standard treatment for certain liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver tumors. Some patients with such tumors already have reduced liver function due to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis before surgery. Therefore, complications due to poor liver function are inevitable after liver resection. Although the mortality rate of liver resection has been reduced to a few percent in recent case series, its overall morbidity rate is reported to range from 4.1{\%} to 47.7{\%}. The large degree of variation in the post-liver resection morbidity rates reported in previous studies might be due to the lack of consensus regarding the definitions and classification of post-liver resection complications. The Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification of post-operative complications is widely accepted internationally. However, it is hard to apply to some major post-liver resection complications because the consensus definitions and grading systems for post-hepatectomy liver failure and bile leakage established by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery are incompatible with the CD classification. Therefore, a unified classification of post-liver resection complications has to be established to allow comparisons between academic reports.},

@article{Kanazawa2013,
abstract = {Although the utility of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized in recent years, the impact of the laparoscopic liver resection for HCC with complete liver cirrhosis (F4) is still unknown. Retrospective analysis of 56 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC (3 cm or smaller in a diameter) and had complete liver cirrhosis (F4) diagnosed histologically was performed. Of the 56 patients, partial hepatectomy was performed under laparotomy in 28 patients (laparotomy group) or under laparoscopy in 28 patients (laparoscopy group). Perioperative outcome was analyzed in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the results of the preoperative liver function tests and the operation time between the two groups. The intraoperative blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group than the laparotomy group (p = 0.0003). The incidence of the postoperative complications was significantly higher in the laparotomy group (20/36 patients) than in the laparoscopy group (3/28 patients, p {\textless} 0.0001). The incidences of surgical site infection, especially incisional infection, and intractable ascites were significantly higher in the laparotomy group than in the laparoscopy group (p = 0.0095, p {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). The proportions of patients who were classified into Clavien's grade I and IIIa were higher in the laparotomy group than in the laparoscopy group (p = 0.0043, p = 0.051, respectively). The duration of the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopy group than in the laparotomy group (p {\textless} 0.0001). The postoperative morbidity, such as surgical site infection and intractable ascites, decreased by the induction of laparoscopic liver resection in patients with liver cirrhosis. As the results, the necessity of invasive treatment for postoperative complications decreased and the duration of the postoperative stay was shortened.},

abstract = {Studies that compare laparoscopic to open liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients are rare and may have suffered from low patient numbers. This work was designed to determine the impact of laparoscopic resection on postoperative and long-term outcomes in a large series of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with open resection. From 2002 to 2009, 36 patients with chronic liver disease with complicating HCC were selected for laparoscopic resection (laparoscopic group, LG). The outcomes were compared with those of 53 patients who underwent open hepatectomy (open group, OG) during the same period in a matched-pair analysis. The two groups were similar in terms of tumor number and size and number of resected segments. Morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the two groups (respectively 25 and 0{\%} in LG vs. 35.8 and 7.5{\%} in OG; p = 0.3). Severe complications were more frequent in OG (13.2{\%}) than in LG (2.8{\%}; p = 0.09). Despite similar portal hypertension levels, complications related to ascites (namely evisceration or variceal bleeding) were fatal in 4 of 12 affected patients in OG but 0 of 5 cases in LG (p = 0.2). The mean hospitalization durations were 6.5 ± 2.7 days and 9.5 ± 4.8 days in LG and OG, respectively (p = 0.003). The surgical margins were similar in the two groups. Although there was a trend toward better 5-year overall survival in LG (70 vs. 46{\%} in OG; p = 0.073), 5-year disease-free survival was similar (35.5 vs. 33.6{\%}). Laparoscopic resection of HCC in patients with chronic liver disease has similar results to open resection in terms of postoperative outcomes, surgical margins, and long-term survival.},

Short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus open resection for HCC and PVH-PLT were compared. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the clinicopathological differences between MIS and non-MIS patents. Univariate comparison and standard survival analyses were utilized. Among 1974 patients who underwent surgery for HCC, 13{\%} had a PVH-PLT and 33{\%} underwent MIS. After 1:1 PSM, 407 MIS and 407 non-MIS patients were analyzed. Incidence of complications and length-of-stay (LoS) were higher among non-MIS versus MIS patients (both p ≤ 0.002). After PSM, among 178 PVH-PLT patients (89 MIS and 89 non-MIS), patients who underwent a non-MIS approach had longer LoS ({\textgreater} 7 days; non-MIS: 55{\%} vs. MIS: 29{\%}), as well as higher morbidity (non-MIS: 42{\%} vs. MIS: 29{\%}) [p {\textless}0.001]. In contrast, long-term oncological outcomes were comparable, including 3-year overall survival (non-MIS: 66.2{\%} vs. MIS: 72.9{\%}) and disease-free survival (non-MIS: 47.3{\%} vs. MIS: 50.2{\%}) [both p ≥ 0.08]. An MIS approach was associated with improved short-term outcomes, but similar long-term outcomes, compared with open liver resection for patients with HCC and PVH-PLT. An MIS approach for liver resection should be considered for patients with HCC, even those individuals with PVH-PLT.},

@article{Buettner2017,
abstract = {Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common malignancy arising from the liver. ICC makes up about 10{\%} of all cholangiocarcinomas. It arises from the peripheral bile ducts within the liver parenchyma, proximal to the secondary biliary radicals. Histologically, the majority of ICCs are adenocarcinomas. Only a minority of patients (15{\%}) present with resectable disease, with a median survival of less than 3 years. Multidisciplinary management of ICC is complicated by large differences in disease course for individual patients both across and within tumor stages. Risk models and nomograms have been developed to more accurately predict survival of individual patients based on clinical parameters. Predictive risk factors are necessary to improve patient selection for systemic treatments. Molecular differences between tumors, such as in the epidermal growth factor receptor status, are promising, but their clinical applicability should be validated. For patients with locally advanced disease, several treatment strategies are being evaluated. Both hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with floxuridine and yttrium-90 embolization aim to downstage locally advanced ICC. Selected patients have resectable disease after downstaging, and other patients might benefit because of postponing widespread dissemination and biliary obstruction.},

abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has become an essential method for treating malignant liver tumors. Although the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of LLR in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported, there are few reports of LLR for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). Methods: Patients who underwent liver resection for T1 or T2 IHCC between March 2010 and March 2015 in Gyeongsang National University Hospital were enrolled. They were divided into open (n = 23) and laparoscopic (n = 14) approaches, and the perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared. Results: The Pringle maneuver was less frequently used (p = 0.015) and estimated blood loss was lesser (p = 0.006) in the laparoscopic group. There were no significant differences in complication rate (p = 1.000), hospital stay (p = 0.371), tumor size (p = 0.159), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.127), and the number of retrieved lymph nodes (p = 0.553). The patients were followed up for a median of 21 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 74.7 and 55.2 {\%}, respectively. No differences were observed in the 3-year OS (75.7 vs 84.6 {\%}, p = 0.672) and RFS (56.7 vs 76.9 {\%}, p = 0.456) rates between the open and laparoscopic groups, even after the groups were divided into patients that received liver resection with or without lymph node dissection. Conclusion: LLR for IHCC is a treatment modality that should be considered as an option alongside open liver resection in selected patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is a rare disease with unfavorable prognosis resulting in low survival rates. This study aims to retrospectively assess the beneficial histopathological features and surgical procedures in long-term survivors (i.e., patients surviving perihilar cholangiocarcinoma for at least 2 y). MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 322 patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma underwent surgery at our center. The follow-up ended in 2017; 76 patients survived for {\textgreater}2 y. The type of resection, UICC stage, and histopathological features were compared between three survival groups ({\textgreater}2-3, {\textgreater}3-5, and {\textgreater}5 y). RESULTS The {\textgreater}5-year-survival rate in our selected study cohort was 43.4{\%} ({\textgreater}3-5 y,31.6{\%} and {\textgreater}2-3 y, 25.0{\%}), and 14.5{\%} of the patients survived for {\textgreater}10 y after surgery. Patients with non-regional lymph node positive tumors and/or distant metastasis (i.e., UICC stage IVb; p=0.0112), R2 status (p=0.0288), and exploratory laparotomy only (p=0.0157) showed the poorest survival rates. Perineural invasion had no significant impact on the overall survival. However, 29.0{\%} patients surviving for {\textgreater}5 y displayed the lowest perineural infiltration prevalence. Interestingly, Bismuth-Corlette stage IIIa (p=0.0467), especially caudate lobectomy (p=0.0034), was associated with disease-specific overall survival of {\textgreater}5y. CONCLUSION Complete/extended tumor resection with additional caudate lobe resection is strongly associated with long-term survival. Perineural infiltration as a negative prognostic marker for prolonged survival needs to be evaluated in larger study cohorts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To clarify the importance of different patterns of infiltration at the proximal border of hilar bile duct carcinomas. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA There are few detailed pathologic studies on the proximal resection margins in patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma. METHODS Serial sections of 62 specimens of resected hilar bile duct carcinoma were examined histologically to determine the involved layers and routes of invasion at the proximal border. The degree of cancer extension was determined, and the relation between the length of the tumor-free resection margin and postoperative anastomotic recurrences was analyzed. RESULTS Mucosal extension was predominant in papillary and nodular tumors, but submucosal extension was predominant in diffusely infiltrating and nodular-infiltrating tumors. Submucosal extension usually consisted of direct or lymphatic invasion. The mean length of submucosal extension was 6.0 mm. Superficial spread of cancer, defined as mucosal extension of more than 20 mm from the main lesion, was seen in 8 specimens. No patient had an anastomotic recurrence when the tumor-free resection margin was greater than 5 mm. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of infiltration at the proximal border of resected hilar bile duct carcinomas is closely related to the gross tumor type. The length of submucosal extension is usually less than 10 mm. Superficial spread of cancer is seen in more than 10{\%} of cases. A tumor-free proximal resection margin of 5 mm appears to be adequate in hilar bile duct carcinoma.},

abstract = {Hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction for biliary malignancy remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the indications for surgery. Patients with advanced hilar bile duct cancer (HBDC) (n = 26) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) involving the hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 13) who underwent hepatectomy were enrolled. They were divided into two groups on the basis of whether vascular reconstruction was performed (HBDC, 10 yes vs. 16 no; GBC, 5 yes vs. 8 no). Portal vein (PV) reconstruction was performed on the right branch in seven patients and on the left branch in two; hepatic artery (HA) reconstruction was done on the right branch in 11 patients and on the left branch in 1. Five patients with HBDC and one with GBC underwent both PV and HA reconstruction. Patency rates were 88.0{\%} and 83.3{\%} for PV and HA reconstructions, respectively. Vascular reconstruction-related morbidity occurred in one patient with fatal liver failure owing to a portal thrombus and in two patients with multiple liver abscesses caused by arterial obstruction. Microsurgery eliminated reconstruction-related morbidity. Mortality in vascular reconstruction cases was 13.3{\%} (2/15), and in those without reconstruction it was 8.3{\%} (2/24). Curability rates (R0 and R1+R2) were 50.0{\%} and 56.0{\%} for HBDC and 40.0{\%} and 62.5{\%} for GBC, respectively. The 3-year survivals of HBDC patients were, respectively, 33{\%} and 42{\%}, and the 5-year survivals were 18{\%} and 25{\%}, whereas for GBC the 1-year survivals were 20{\%} and 60{\%} and the 2-year survivals 0{\%} and 25{\%}. Two patients with vascular involvement who underwent PV with HA reconstruction survived more than 3 years. Hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction for selected HBDC patients offers low surgical risk and increased survival by curable resection, but it is not recommended for advanced GBC.},

abstract = {Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts is defined as an adenocarcinoma arising in proximal, middle third, and distal (lower third) parts of extrahepatic ducts. As anatomically a division of the duct system into thirds is artificial, novel classifications distinguish perihilar/hilar cholangiocarcinomas from those of the mid-region and the distal part of the common bile duct. For the definition of perihilar cancers, the separation point between intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumors is defined by the level of second-order bile ducts. Bile ducts located to the hepatic plate of the hilum correspond to extrahepatic bile ducts. The growth patterns and associated clinical sequelae vary as a function of anatomical location. Perihilar/hilar tumor forms concentrically stenosing lesions (Klatskin tumors). Tumors in the mid-region more commonly present as tubular lesion with thickening of the duct wall, whereas distal tumor more often shows an exophytic growth pattern. Histologically, the neoplasms are adenocarcinomas of the cholangiocyte lineage, usually associated with abundant stroma (desmoplasia). The cancers have a strong tendency for perineural and intraneural invasion, extension along bile ducts, and lymphatic spread.},

Although it remains a controversial multidisciplinary approach, the combination of these extended procedures with an adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment is a promising approach for further improving the resectability of tumors and the survival of patients.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) represent most of the causes of death in patients with colorectal cancer. Surgical resection is the only treatment that can provide the possibility of prolonged survival, or even cure, for patients with CRLM. Over the last few decades, survival of these patients has improved dramatically thanks to more effective chemotherapy, extension of surgical indications, and development of new surgical procedures. In particular, patients with initially unresectable CRLM can achieve downsizing of the tumor by using various chemotherapies and the tumor can become resectable. It has been shown that such patients have a 33{\%} 5-year survival and a 23{\%} 10-year survival rate after surgery, which is a little bit lower than that of patents with resectable CRLM but significantly higher than patients without surgery. However, a decision-making strategy for patients with CRLM is difficult because there is a wide variety of treatments and no definitive consensus. As an example, much variation among institutions exists on the resectability rate in patients with unresectable CRLM. Also, it is recommended that all patients with CRLM be managed by a multidisciplinary approach (MDA) to select the best strategy. In the future, new treatment procedures (e.g. immune checkpoint blockade, liver transplantation) may contribute to improve prognosis; hence, the necessity for MDA for the treatment of CRLM will further increase.},

@article{Moris2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract. Introduction: Colorectal liver metastases develop in 50{\%} of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Surgical resection for colorectal liver metastasis typically involves either anatomical resection (AR) or parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy (PSH). The objective of the current study was to analyze data on parenchymal versus non-parenchymal-sparing hepatic resections for CLM. Methods: A systematic review of the literature regarding parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy was performed. MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched for publications containing the following medical subject headings (MeSH): “Colorectal Neoplasms,” “Neoplasm Metastasis,” “Liver Neopl asms” and “Hepatectomy”. Besides, the following keywords were used to complete the literature search: “Hepatectomy,” “liver resection,” “hepatic resection,” “anatomic/anatomical,” “nonanatomic/ nonanatomical,” “major,” “minor,” “limited,” “wedge,” “CRLM/CLM,” and “colorectal liver metastasis.” Data was reviewed, aggregated, and analyzed. Results: Two thousand five hundred five patients included in 12 studies who underwent either PSH (n = 1087 patients) or AR (n = 1418 patients) were identified. Most patients had a primary tumor that originated in the colon (PSH 52.2–74.4{\%} vs. AR 53.9–74.3{\%}) (P = 0.289). The majority of studies included a large subset of patients with only a solitary tumor with a reported median tumor number of 1–2 regardless of whether the patient underwent PSH or AR. Median EBL was no different among patients undergoing PSH (100–896 mL) versus AR (200–1489 mL) for CLM (P = 0.248). There was no difference in median length-of-stay following PSH (6–17 days) versus AR (7–15 days) (P = 0.747). While there was considerable inter-study variability regarding margin status, there was no difference in the incidence of R0 resection among patients undergoing PSH (66.7–100{\%}) versus AR (71.6–98.6{\%}) (P = 0.58). When assessing overall survival, there was no difference whether resection of CLM was performed with PSH (5 years OS: mean 44.7{\%}, range 29–62{\%}) or AR (5 years OS: mean 44.6{\%}, range 27–64{\%}) (P = 0.97). Conclusion: PSH had a comparable safety and efficacy profile compared with AR and did not compromise oncologic outcomes. PSH should be considered an appropriate surgical approach to treatment for patients with CLM that facilitates preservation of hepatic parenchyma.},

@article{Matsumura2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Society of Surgical Oncology. Background: Prophylactic impact of major hepatectomy (MH) on liver recurrence has yet to be clarified in patients with advanced colorectal liver metastases (CLMs). Methods: In our institute, parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy (PSH) is a standard procedure for CLMs consistently throughout initial and repeat resection, and MH is selected only in cases in which CLMs are close to major Glisson's pedicles. We reviewed 145 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for advanced CLMs (≥4 nodules and ≤50 mm in size) from 1999 to 2012. Surgical outcomes and survival were compared between patients who underwent PSH and MH. Results: PSH was performed in 113 patients (77.9 {\%}) and MH in 32 (22.1 {\%}) patients with advanced CLMs. Tumor characteristics and short-term outcomes did not differ between the 2 groups. Incidence of positive tumor margin (8.8 {\%} in PSH vs 9.4 {\%} in MH; p = .927) and rates of liver-only recurrence (43.4 {\%} in PSH and 50.0 {\%} in MH; p = .505) did not differ. No significant differences were found in 5-year overall survival (37.0 {\%} in PSH vs 29.4 {\%} in MH, p = .473), recurrence-free survival (7.6 vs 6.8 {\%}, p = .597), and liver recurrence-free survival (21.0 vs 21.3 {\%}, p = .691). A total of 65 patients had liver-only recurrence, for which repeat hepatectomy was performed in 81.5 {\%} (53 of 65) following our parenchymal-sparing approach. Conclusions: In patients with advanced CLM, PSH does not increase positive surgical margin or liver recurrence in comparison with MH. A parenchymal-sparing approach offers a high rate of repeat resection for liver recurrence (salvageability).},

Although the number of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is decreasingly considered as a contraindication to surgery, patients with 10 CLM or more are often denied liver surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome after liver surgery and to identify prognostic factors of survival in such patients.Methods:The study population consisted of a multicentre cohort of patients with CLM (N=12 406) operated on, with intention to resect, from January 2005-June 2013 and whose data were prospectively collected in the LiverMetSurvey registry.Results:Overall, the group {\^{a}}(c) 3/410 CLM (N=529, 4.3{\%}) experienced a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 30{\%}. A macroscopically complete (R0/R1) resection (72.8{\%} of patients) was associated with a 3- A nd 5-year OS of 61{\%} and 39{\%} vs 29{\%} and 5{\%} for R2/no resection patients (P{\textless}0.0001). At multivariate analysis, R0/R1 resection emerged as the strongest favourable factor of OS (HR 0.35 (0.26-0.48)). Other independent favourable factors were as follows: Maximal tumour size {\textless}40 mm (HR 0.67 (0.49-0.92)); age {\textless}60 years (HR 0.66 (0.50-0.88)); preoperative MRI (HR 0.65 (0.47-0.89)); and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.73 (0.55-0.98)). The model showed that 5-year OS rates of 30{\%} was possible provided R0/R1 resection associated with at least an additional favourable factor.Conclusions:Liver resection might provide long-term survival in patients with {\^{a}}(c) 3/410 CLM staged with preoperative MRI, provided R0/R1 resection followed by adjuvant therapy. A validation of these results in another cohort is needed.},

@article{Torzilli2017,
abstract = {Background: The recent advent of more effective chemotherapy and the development of surgical procedures have expanded the pool of resectable patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Two-stage hepatectomy (TSH), associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS), and ultrasound-guided enhanced one-stage hepatectomy (e-OSH) are the surgical solutions proposed for these patients, but the range of indications for these procedures vary from institution to institution. Summary: The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are herein discussed. Patients who drop out between the staged operations of TSH limit its success rate, although predictive scores may help with patient selection and thereby optimize the results. Safety and oncological suitability are concerns to be addressed when considering ALPPS. These concerns notwithstanding, ALPPS has introduced an innovative concept in surgery: the monosegmental remnant liver. Studies involving e-OSH have proven the oncological suitability of tumor exposure once the CLM is detached from major intrahepatic vessels. This fnding could expand the indications for e-OSH, although the technical challenges that it entails limit its spread among the surgical community. The liver-frst approach involves the clearance of tumors from the liver before the colorectal primary is tackled. This approach fully justifes the complexity of e-OSH. Key Messages: Predictive scores limiting the interstage dropout of TSH, partial and monosegmental ALPPS, and R1 vascular e-OSH justifed by solid long-term results represent new insights that could help refne the patient assignment to each of these approaches. Additionally, liver transplantation is an emerging treatment for CLM that should be taken into account.},

@article{Ratti2018a,
abstract = {Importance: Surgery represents the mainstay treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Indications for the laparoscopic approach in this setting have been widened and there is a need to confirm the benefits of minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) in patients with complex disease states. Objective: To compare outcomes of laparoscopic surgery with those of open surgery for liver metastases from colorectal cancer, focusing on the characteristics of modern MILS and therefore overcoming possible selection bias related to different policies for patients' eligibility for MILS over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cohort study of 885 resections performed for liver metastases from colorectal cancer between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2017, at the Hepatobiliary Surgery Unit of San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy, comprising 187 laparoscopic and 698 open resections. Procedures performed using the MILS approach with a ratio of MILS to total resections per year of more than 30{\%} were considered and were matched by propensity scores (ratio of 1:4) to procedures performed using the open approach with a ratio of MILS to total resections per year of less than 30{\%}. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was short-term outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, functional recovery, and interval between surgery and adjuvant treatments; the secondary end point was long-term outcomes. Results: Among this cohort (104 patients in the MILS group; 46 women and 58 men; median age, 62 years [range, 35-81 years]; and 412 patients in the open group; 181 women and 231 men; median age, 60 years [range, 37-80 years]), primary end-point data showed a significantly higher incidence of postoperative morbidity in patients who underwent open resections compared with those who underwent MILS (94 [22.8{\%}] vs 21 [20.2{\%}]; P =.04). Patients in the MILS group had fewer major complications (Dindo-Clavien grades III-V) compared with patients in the open group (Dindo-Clavien grades III-V; 7 [6.7{\%}] vs 35 [8.5{\%}]; P =.03) as well as shorter lengths of stay (median [range] duration, 3 [2-35] vs 5 [4-37] days; P =.02). Oncologic results were not compromised by the laparoscopic approach. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the results of the propensity score matching analysis between modern laparoscopic surgery and previous open surgery appear to confer more comparable cohorts for complexity, further supporting the advantages of laparoscopy in the surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The increase in use that laparoscopy has experienced appears to be based on increased feasibility, widening of eligibility criteria for patients, enhanced clinical effectiveness, and oncologic outcomes. All these elements together suggest that up to 70{\%} of patients appear to be candidates for this minimally invasive surgical approach in high-volume centers.},

abstract = {Background: This study evaluates the surgical stress response following laparoscopic and open liver resection for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). Methods: Patients with CRLM were prospectively randomized to receive open or laparoscopic liver resection (NCT03131778). Blood samples were drawn preoperatively and 24 h after resection. The serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 levels were measured. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of angiogenesis-related factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and HIF-1) and inflammation-related factors (COX-2 and MMP-9) in both tumor tissue and normal liver parenchyma were detected. Results: Twenty patients for each arm were included. Size of metastasis, type of resection, and neoadjuvant therapy were comparable between groups. Postoperative stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group. Higher levels of IL-6 were observed after the operation in both open and laparoscopic groups, although no differences in the post-operative levels between the groups was noted. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of VEGF, HIF-1, MMP-9, and COX-2 between the treatment groups. No differences were observed in terms of overall survival and disease free survival. Conclusions: The immunological effects of treatment were similar between the groups. Thus, the laparoscopic approach does not seem to significantly influence the surgical stress and tumor related factors in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases.},

Eight inflammatory markers increased significantly from baseline: HMGB-1, cfDNA, interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein, macrophage inflammatory protein-1b, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL-10, and terminal C5b-9 complement complex. Peak levels were reached at the end of or shortly after surgery. Five markers, HMGB-1, cfDNA, IL-6, Creactive protein, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1b, showed significantly higher levels in the open surgery group compared with the laparoscopic surgery group. Laparoscopic resection of CLM reduced the inflammatory response compared with open resection. The lower level of HMGB-1 is interesting because of the known association with oncogenesis.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic liver resection is increasingly used for the surgical treatment of liver tumors. However, high-level evidence to conclude that laparoscopic liver resection is superior to open liver resection is lacking. METHODS Explanatory, assessor-blinded, single center, randomized superiority trial recruiting patients from Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway from February 2012 to January 2016. A total of 280 patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 133) or open (n = 147) parenchyma-sparing liver resection. The primary outcome was postoperative complications within 30 days (Accordion grade 2 or higher). Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, postoperative hospital stay, blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. RESULTS The postoperative complication rate was 19{\%} in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 31{\%} in the open-surgery group (12 percentage points difference [95{\%} confidence interval 1.67-21.8; P = 0.021]). The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic surgery (53 vs 96 hours, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas there were no differences in blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly from the laparoscopic group (0 patients) to the open group (1 patient). In a 4-month perspective, the costs were equal, whereas patients in the laparoscopic-surgery group gained 0.011 quality-adjusted life years compared to patients in the open-surgery group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing parenchyma-sparing liver resection for colorectal metastases, laparoscopic surgery was associated with significantly less postoperative complications compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic resection was cost-effective compared to open resection with a 67{\%} probability. The rate of free resection margins was the same in both groups. Our results support the continued implementation of laparoscopic liver resection.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is increasingly performed in specialized centers. While there is a trend towards a parenchyma-sparing strategy in multimodal treatment for CLM, its role is yet unclear. In this study we present short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing liver resection (LPSLR) at a single center. LLR were performed in 951 procedures between August 1998 and March 2017 at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Patients who primarily underwent LPSLR for CLM were included in the study. LPSLR was defined as non-anatomic hence the patients who underwent hemihepatectomy and sectionectomy were excluded. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. The Accordion classification was used to grade postoperative complications. The median follow-up was 40 months. 296 patients underwent primary LPSLR for CLM. A single specimen was resected in 204 cases, multiple resections were performed in 92 cases. 5 laparoscopic operations were converted to open. The median operative time was 134 minutes, blood loss was 200 ml and hospital stay was 3 days. There was no 90-day mortality in this study. The postoperative complication rate was 14.5{\%}. 189 patients developed disease recurrence. Recurrence in the liver occurred in 146 patients (49{\%}), of whom 85 patients underwent repeated surgical treatment (liver resection [n = 69], ablation [n = 14] and liver transplantation [n = 2]). Five-year overall survival was 48{\%}, median overall survival was 56 months. LPSLR of CLM can be performed safely with the good surgical and oncological results. The technique facilitates repeated surgical treatment, which may improve survival for patients with CLM.},

abstract = {Background The oncological benefit of repeat hepatectomy for patients with recurrent colorectal metastases is not yet proven. This study assessed the value of repeat hepatectomy for these patients within current multidisciplinary treatment. Methods Consecutive patients treated by repeat hepatectomy for colorectal metastases between January 1990 and January 2010 were included. Patients undergoing two-stage hepatectomy were excluded. Postoperative outcome was analysed and compared with that of patients who had only a single hepatectomy. Results A total of 1036 patients underwent 1454 hepatectomies for colorectal metastases. Of these, 288 patients had 362 repeat hepatectomies for recurrent metastases. Some 225 patients (78{\textperiodcentered}1 per cent) had two hepatectomies, 52 (18{\textperiodcentered}1 per cent) had three hepatectomies, and 11 patients (3{\textperiodcentered}8 per cent) had a fourth hepatectomy. Postoperative morbidity following repeat hepatectomy was similar to that after initial liver resection (27{\textperiodcentered}1 per cent after first, 34{\textperiodcentered}4 per cent after second and 33{\textperiodcentered}3 per cent after third hepatectomy) (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}069). The postoperative mortality rate was 3{\textperiodcentered}1 per cent after repeat hepatectomy versus 1{\textperiodcentered}6 per cent after first hepatectomy. Three- and 5-year overall survival rates following first hepatectomy in patients who underwent repeat hepatectomy were 76 and 54 per cent respectively, compared with 58 and 45 per cent in patients who had only one hepatectomy (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}003). In multivariable analysis, repeat hepatectomy performed between 2000 and 2010 was the sole independent factor associated with longer overall survival.

abstract = {Background: The safety and feasibility of laparoscopic, two-stage hepatectomy for bilobar colorectal liver metastases is poorly evaluated. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively 86 consecutive patients who underwent complete two-stage hepatectomy (left lobe clearance as the first stage and standard/extended right hepatectomy as the second stage) for bilobar colorectal liver metastases between 2007 and 2017 in 2 tertiary centers. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between laparoscopic and open two-stage hepatectomy before and after propensity score matching. Results: Laparoscopic two-stage hepatectomy was performed in 38 patients and open two-stage hepatectomy in 48. After propensity score matching, 25 laparoscopic and 25 open patients showed similar preoperative characteristics. For the first stage, a laparoscopic approach was associated with lesser hospital stays (4 vs 7.5 days; P {\textless}.001). For the second stage, a laparoscopic approach was associated with less blood loss (250 vs 500 mL; P =.040), less postoperative complications (32{\%} vs 60{\%}; P =.047), lesser hospital stays (9 vs 16 days; P =.013), and earlier administration of chemotherapy (1.6 vs 2 months; P =.039). Overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and liver-recurrence-free survival were comparable between the groups (3-year overall survival: 80{\%} vs 54{\%}; P =.154; 2-year recurrence-free survival: 20{\%} vs 18{\%}; P =.200; 2-year liver-recurrence-free survival: 39{\%} vs 33{\%}; P =.269). Although both groups had comparable recurrence patterns, repeat hepatectomies for recurrence were performed more frequently in the laparoscopic two-stage hepatectomy group (56{\%} vs 0{\%}; P =.006). Conclusion: Laparoscopic two-stage hepatectomy for bilobar colorectal liver metastases is safe and feasible with favorable surgical and oncologic outcomes compared to open two-stage hepatectomy.},

@article{DeHaas2008,
abstract = {Objective: To compare long-term outcome of R0 (negative margins) and R1 (positive margins) liver resections for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) treated by an aggressive approach combining chemotherapy and repeat surgery. Summary Background Data: Complete macroscopic resection with negative margins is the gold standard recommendation in the surgical treatment of CLM. However, due to vascular proximity or multinodularity, complete macroscopic resection can sometimes only be performed through R1 resection. Increasingly efficient chemotherapy may have changed long-term outcome after R1 resection. Methods: All resected CLM patients (R0 or R1) at our institution between 1990 and 2006 were prospectively evaluated. Exclusion criteria were: macroscopic incomplete (R2) resection, use of local treatment modalities, and presence of extrahepatic disease. We aimed to resect all identified metastases with negative margins. However, when safe margins could not be obtained, resection was still performed provided complete macroscopic tumor removal. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were compared between groups, and prognostic factors were identified. Results: Of 840 patients, 436 (52{\%}) were eligible for the study, 234 (28{\%}) of whom underwent R0 resection, and 202 (24{\%}) underwent R1 resection. Number and size of CLM were higher, and distribution was more often bilateral in the R1 group. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, 5-year OS was 61{\%} and 57{\%} for R0 and R1 patients (P = 0.27). Five-year disease-free survival was 29{\%} in the R0 group versus 20{\%} in the R1 group (P = 0.12). In the R1 group, intrahepatic (but not surgical margin) recurrences were more often observed (28{\%} vs. 17{\%}; P = 0.004). Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level ≥ 10 ng/mL and major hepatectomy, but not R1 resection, were independent predictors of poor OS. Size ≥ 30 mm, bilateral distribution, and intraoperative blood transfusions independently predicted positive surgical margins. Conclusions: Despite a higher recurrence rate, the contraindication of R1 resection should be revisited in the current era of effective chemotherapy because survival is similar to that of R0 resection.

abstract = {Background Liver transplantation to treat neuroendocrine tumors, especially in the setting of diffuse liver involvement not amenable to operative resection remains controversial. We sought to perform a systematic review of the current literature to summarize data on patients undergoing liver transplantation with neuroendocrine tumors liver metastases as the indication. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Eligible studies were identified using 3 distinct databases through March 2017: Medline (PubMed), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a search algorithm: “(neuroendocrine or NET) and transplantation and liver.” Results From the 1,216 records retrieved, 64 studies were eligible. Overall, 4 studies presented data from registries, namely the European Liver Transplant Registry and the United Network for Organ Transplantation/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network databases, 3 were multicenter studies. The largest cohort of data on patients undergoing liver transplantation for neuroendocrine tumors liver metastasis indication were from single center studies comprising a total of 279 patients. Pancreas was the primary tumor site for most patients followed by the ileum. Several studies reported that more than half of patients presented with synchronous disease (55.9{\%} and 57.7{\%}); in contrast, metachronous neuroendocrine tumors liver metastasis ranged from 17.7{\%} to 38.7{\%}. Overall, recurrence after liver transplantation ranged from 31.3{\%} to 56.8{\%}. Reported 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival was 89{\%}, 69{\%}, and 63{\%}, respectively. Several prognostic factors associated with worse long-term survival including transplantation {\textgreater}50{\%} liver tumor involvement, high Ki67, as well as a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors versus gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors tumor location. Conclusion Liver transplantation may provide a survival benefit among patients with diffuse neuroendocrine tumors metastases to the liver. However, due to high recurrence rates, strict selection of patients is critical. Due to the scarcity of available grafts and the lack of level 1 evidence, the recommendations to endorse liver transplantation for extensive liver neuroendocrine tumors metastases warrants ongoing deliberations.},

@article{Liu2009,
abstract = {The development of new technologies and therapies provides an exciting new chapter in the management of neuroendocrine disease. Fundamentally (albeit through an extensive array of retrospectively based studies), the use of cytoreductive therapies (whether it be through open surgery, laparoscopic approaches, percutaneous, or endovascular) have clearly demonstrated the ability to control symptoms, decrease tumor burden, and in selected series, translate into survival benefit. However, this situation is not without challenge, as overall strategy and consensus has not been reached as to the optimal therapy. In general, local regional therapy for hepatic metastatic disease should begin with the decision of the intent to treat. Transplant (which, at present has a very limited role), surgical resection, and ablative therapies, such as RF, cryoablation, and microwave provide (in these circumstances) the only options for 100{\%} destruction of macroscopic disease (ie, that disease burden that is visualized by current imaging technology), assuming that the primary tumor has been removed or resected. Endovascular methods may have the ability to treat microscopic disease, however, is considered palliative, as the entire disease burden may not be fully addressed. One potential advantage of endovascular therapy (and in particular Y-90 radioembolization) is to provide the possibility to downstage (shrink) disease to resection or ablation, while providing cytoreduction. Although not discussed in this forum, systemic therapeutic options also offer much promise, and readers are encouraged to examine the current literature in this regard. A summary of recent published literature concerning response and applications of systemic chemotherapy (Table 1) and systemic radiotherapy is provided for review (Table 4). With the advancement of local regional disease management through medical, surgical, and radiologic methods, a multidisciplinary approach must be implemented to prospectively develop treatment algorithms and draw from the expertise and experience of each discipline. The current challenges facing the medical and patient community are deciding what the best-suited therapy is for an individual, given the state of the art. No therapy is without inherent risk, and thus the second consideration, the risk to benefit ratio must also be discussed. Simply put, it must be ensured that the benefit derived from the procedure or intervention must outweigh the risk, effect on quality of life, and the potential of effecting other therapeutic options. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

However, resection of non-colorectal liver metastases (NCRLMs) remains controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for NCRLMs. Methods: From a prospectively maintained database between 2000 and 2018, patients undergoing LLR for colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) and NCRLMs were selected. Clinicopathologic, operative, short- and long-term outcome data were collected, analyzed, and compared among patients with CRLMs and NCRLMs. Results: The primary tumor was colorectal in 354 (82.1{\%}), neuroendocrine in 21 (4.9{\%}), and non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine in the remaining 56 (13{\%}) patients. Major postoperative morbidities were 12.7{\%}, 19{\%}, and 3.6{\%}, respectively (p = 0.001), whereas the mortality was 0.6{\%} for patients with CRLMs and zero for patients with NCRLMs. The rate of R1 surgical margin was comparable (p = 0.432) among groups. According to the survival analysis, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 76.1{\%} and 64.3{\%} in the CRLM group, 57.1{\%} and 42.3{\%} in the neuroendocrine liver metastase (NELM) group, 33{\%} and 20.8{\%} in the non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine liver metastase (NCRNNELM) group (p = 0.001), respectively. Three- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 88.3{\%} and 82.7{\%} in the CRLM group, 85.7{\%} and 70.6{\%} in the NELM group, 71.4{\%} and 52.9{\%} in the NCRNNELM group (p = 0.001), respectively. In total, 113 out of 354 (31.9{\%}) patients with CRLMs, 2 out of 21(9.5{\%}) with NELMs, and 8 out of 56 (14.3{\%}) patients with NCRNNELMs underwent repeat LLR for recurrent metastatic tumors. Conclusion: LLR is safe and feasible in the context of a multimodal management where an aggressive surgical approach, necessitating even complex procedures for bilobar multifocal metastases and repeat hepatectomy for recurrences, is the mainstay and may be of benefit in the long-term survival, in selected patients with NCRNNELMs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of hepatic resection (HR) in the treatment of patients with noncolorectal nonendocrine liver metastases (NCNELM). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The place of HR in the treatment of NCNELM remains controversial, primarily due to the limitations of previously published reports and the heterogeneity of primary tumor sites and histologies. METHODS: A multivariate risk model was developed by analyzing prognostic factors and long-term outcomes in 1452 patients with NCNELM treated with HR at 41 centers from 1983 to 2004. RESULTS: Hepatic metastases were solitary in 56{\%} and unilateral in 71{\%} (mean diameter, 50.5 mm). Extrahepatic metastases were present in 22{\%}. The most common primary sites were breast (32{\%}), gastrointestinal (16{\%}), and urologic (14{\%}). The most common histologies were adenocarcinoma (60{\%}), GIST/sarcoma (13.5{\%}), and melanoma (13{\%}). R0 resection was achieved in 83{\%} of patients with a 60-day mortality rate of 2.3{\%} and a major complication rate of 21.5{\%}. Tumor recurred in 67{\%} of patients (liver, 24{\%}; extrahepatic, 18{\%}; both, 25{\%}). Overall and disease-free survivals at 5 years were 36{\%} and 21{\%} and at 10 years were 23{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with poor prognosis were patient age {\textgreater}60 years, nonbreast origin, melanoma or squamous histology, disease-free interval {\textless}12 months, extrahepatic metastases, R2 resection, and major hepatectomy (all P ≤ 0.02). A prognostic model based on these factors effectively stratified patients into low-risk (0-3 points, 46{\%} 5-year survival), mid-risk (4-6 points, 33{\%} 5-year survival), and high-risk ({\textgreater}6 points, {\textless}10{\%} 5-year survival) groups (P = 0.0001). DISCUSSION: HR for NCNELM is safe and effective, with outcomes mainly dependent on primary tumor site and histology. For individual patients, a statistical model based on key prognostic factors could validate the indication for hepatic resection by predicting long-term survivals.

abstract = {Background: Liver resection is a treatment of choice for colorectal and neuroendocrine liver metastases, and laparoscopy is an accepted approach for surgical treatment of these patients. The role of liver resection for patients with non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases (NCNNLM), however, is still disputable. Outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection for this group of patients have not been analyzed. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection for NCNNLM at Oslo University Hospital between April 2000 and January 2018 were analyzed. Perioperative and oncologic data of these patients were examined. Postoperative morbidity was classified using the Accordion classification. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Median follow-up was 26 (IQR, 12-41) months. Results: Fifty-one patients were identified from a prospectively collected database. The histology of primary tumors was classified as adenocarcinoma (n = 16), sarcoma (n = 4), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4), melanoma (n = 16), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 9), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n = 2). The median operative time was 147 (IQR, 95-225) min, while the median blood loss was 200 (IQR, 50-500) ml. Nine (18{\%}) patients experienced postoperative complications. There was no 90-day mortality in this study. Thirty-five (68{\%}) patients developed disease recurrence or progression. Seven (14{\%}) patients underwent repeat surgical procedure for recurrent liver metastases. One-, three-, and five-year overall survival rates were 85{\%}, 52{\%}, and 38{\%}, respectively. The median overall survival was 37 (95{\%}CI, 25 to 49) months. Conclusion: Laparoscopic liver resection for NCNNLM results in good outcomes and should be considered in patients selected for surgical treatment.},

abstract = {Background Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign hepatic lesion that may be complicated by bleeding and malignant transformation. The aim of the present study is to report on large series of liver resections for HCA and assess the incidence of hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study, from 27 European high-volume HPB units. Results 573 patients were analyzed. The female: male gender ratio was 8:2, mean age: 37 ± 10 years. Of the 84 (14{\%}) patients whose initial presentation was hemorrhagic shock (Hemorrhagic HCAs), hemostatic intervention was urgently required in 25 (30{\%}) patients. No patients died after intervention. Tumor size was {\textgreater}5 cm in 74{\%} in hemorrhagic HCAs and 64{\%} in non-hemorrhagic HCAs (p {\textless} 0.001). In non-hemorrhagic HCAs (n = 489), 5{\%} presented with malignant transformation. Male status and tumor size {\textgreater}10 cm were the two predictive factors. Liver resections included major hepatectomy in 25{\%} and a laparoscopic approach in 37{\%} of the patients. In non-hemorrhagic HCAs, there was no mortality and major complications occurred in 9{\%} of patients. Discussion Liver resection for HCA is safe. Presentation with hemorrhage was associated with larger tumor size. In males with a HCA {\textgreater}10 cm, a HCC should be suspected. In such situation, a preoperative biopsy is preferable and an oncological liver resection should be considered.},

abstract = {Background: The value of open and minimally invasive liver resection for symptomatic solid benign liver tumours (BLT) such as hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia and haemangioma is being debated. A systematic review on symptom relief, quality of life (QoL) and surgical outcome after both open and minimally invasive surgery for solid BLT is currently lacking. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines (January 1985–April 2018). Articles reporting pre-and postoperative symptoms or QoL in patients undergoing open or minimally surgery for BLT were evaluated. Methodological quality was assessed using the MINORS tool. Results: Forty-two studies were included with 4061 patients undergoing surgery for BLT, 3536 (87{\%}) open and 525 (13{\%}) laparoscopic resections. Randomized and propensity-matched studies were lacking. Symptoms were the indication for resection in 56{\%} of the patients. After a weighted mean of 28.5 months follow-up after surgery, symptoms were relieved in 82{\%} of symptomatic patients. Validated QoL tools were used in eight studies, of which two found significant better QoL scores following laparoscopic compared to open surgery. Discussion: Resection of symptomatic BLT seems safe and relieves symptoms in the vast majority of selected patients. Comparative studies are needed before more firm conclusions can be drawn.},

abstract = {Background: Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a hepatocyte derived neoplastic lesion with an increasing incidence and a strong association with oestrogen therapy. Laparoscopic resection has proven safe for small, non-ruptured lesions whilst its use for large adenomas (≥10 cm) and cases of haemorrhage requires further investigation. Methods: All patients undergoing liver resection for HCA at the Royal Brisbane Hospital between January 2003 and April 2018 were analysed. Ethics approval was obtained. Results: Thirty-three laparoscopic and three open resections were performed in 35 patients, all female, with a median age of 35 years (range 14–75). Nine laparoscopic resections were performed for large adenomas (≥10 cm) and 17 laparoscopic resections were performed for adenomas of intermediate size (5–9.9 cm). Only one conversion to open surgery was required for an intermediate sized tumour. Haemorrhage, either intratumoural, intraparenchymal or free intraperitoneal was the indication for resection in six of the 33 laparoscopic cases. Median operative time was 143 and 266 min for laparoscopically resected intermediate and large lesions, respectively. The median length of stay was 5 days (range 4–9) and no major complications were observed in the laparoscopic group. $\beta$-catenin mutation was seen in four of nine large adenomas whereas the inflammatory subtype constituted 11 of 17 intermediate sized lesions. Conclusion: Laparoscopic surgery has been demonstrated to be safe for the resection of HCA in this group of patients. Importantly, haemorrhage and/or large size were not barriers to laparoscopic resection.},

We here present a case of a 78-year-old female patient who was initially admitted to our department due to fever and jaundice for 2 days. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography scan showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation with liver atrophy of left lobe. Unenhanced nodules were seen within the left intrahepatic bile duct. Ultrasonography revealed intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation with viscous fluid, tubular adenoma? Tumor markers including alpha fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 were normal. Preoperative total bilirubin was 64.4mmol/L. Laparoscopic anatomical left hepatectomy and common bile duct exploration were performed. In this procedure, a lot of mucus was seen within the common bile duct and left intrahepatic bile duct. No bile duct stones were found after the exploration. During parenchymal transection, intraoperative hemorrhage from middle hepatic vein was met, and we repaired middle hepatic vein by laparoscopic suture (5-0 Prolene). No air embolism and hypotension were met. This operation took 232 minutes and estimated blood loss was 300mL. Postoperative ultrasonography indicated a normal outflow of middle hepatic vein and there was no stricture. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and was discharged on the 6th day after surgery. Postoperative pathological diagnosis was intrahepatic bile duct papillary mucinous cystadenoma.},

abstract = {Echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by cestodes of the genus Echinococcus (family Taeniidae). This serious and near-cosmopolitan disease continues to be a significant public health issue, with western China being the area of highest endemicity for both the cystic (CE) and alveolar (AE) forms of echinococcosis. Considerable advances have been made in the 21st century on the genetics, genomics, and molecular epidemiology of the causative parasites, on diagnostic tools, and on treatment techniques and control strategies, including the development and deployment of vaccines. In terms of surgery, new procedures have superseded traditional techniques, and total cystectomy in CE, ex vivo resection with autotransplantation in AE, and percutaneous and perendoscopic procedures in both diseases have improved treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients. In this review, we summarize recent progress on the biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, control, and prevention of CE and AE. Currently there is no alternative drug to albendazole to treat echinococcosis, and new compounds are required urgently. Recently acquired genomic and proteomic information can provide a platform for improving diagnosis and for finding new drug and vaccine targets, with direct impact in the future on the control of echinococcosis, which continues to be a global challenge.},

Complete resection followed by adjuvant therapy remains the only curative treatment available. Curative surgery is performed by open or laparoscopic approach depending on the extent of the disease and the experience of the surgical team. Palliative resections are typically not indicated, because the availability of endoscopic treatments of biliary complications and long-term benzimidazoles represent efficient alternatives to surgery. Liver transplantation as an alternative to palliative surgery has not been shown to be superior to long-term conservative therapy.

These branches and their ramification type in the caudate lobe showed that this lobe includes: (1) the Spiegel lobe; (2) the paracaval portion; and (3) the caudate process portion. The three portions often have their own independent branches; for example, the portal venous and biliary branches of the Spiegel lobe were ramified mainly from the left-side tract, whereas those of the caudate process portion were ramified from the right-side tract. The portal venous branches of the paracaval portion were ramified mainly from the left portal vein, while the biliary branches of this portion drained into the right and left biliary tracts at almost equal frequencies. In most cases, the peripheral branches reached the liver surface beneath the diaphragm. Thus, the present division of the caudate lobe into three portions could make the extent of the caudate lobe clear and is considered logical from a clinical viewpoint.},

abstract = {Anatomical liver resection with the Glissonean pedicle isolation is widely approved as an essential procedure for safety and curability. Especially, the extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle isolation without parenchymal destruction should be an ideal procedure. However, the surgical technique has not been standardized due to a lack of anatomical understanding. Herein, we proposed a novel comprehensive surgical anatomy of the liver based on Laennec's capsule that would give a theoretical background to the extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle isolation. Laennec's capsule is the proper membrane that covers not only the entire surface of the liver including the bare area but also the intrahepatic parenchyma surrounding the Glissonean pedicles. Consequently, there exists a gap between the Glissonean pedicle and Laennec's capsule that could be reached extrahepatically and allows us to isolate the extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle without parenchymal destruction systematically. For standardization, it is essential to approach the “six gates” indicated by the “four anatomical landmarks”: the Arantius plate, the umbilical plate, the cystic plate and the Glissonean pedicle of the caudate process (G1c). This novel anatomy would contribute to standardize the surgical techniques of the systematic extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle isolation for anatomical liver resection including laparoscopic or robotic liver resection and to bring innovative changes in hepatobiliary surgery for spreading safe and curable liver resection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To investigate the risk factors for conversion during laparoscopic liver resection and its effect on patient outcome in a large cohort of patients. Additional analysis of outcomes in patients who required conversion for unfavorable intraoperative findings and conversion for unfavorable intraoperative events will be performed to establish if the cause of conversion effects outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Multiple previous studies demonstrate that laparoscopic liver surgery reduces intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and morbidity while maintaining comparable oncological and survival outcomes when compared with open liver resections. However, limited information is available regarding the possible sequelae of conversion to open surgery, especially with regards to cause of conversion. METHODS:: A retrospective analysis of 2861 cases from prospectively maintained databases of 7 tertiary liver centers across Europe was performed. RESULTS:: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, previous liver resection(s), resections for malignant lesions, postero-superior location, and the extent of the resection are associated with an increased risk of conversion. Patients who require conversion have longer operations with higher blood loss; a longer HDU and total hospital stay, increased frequency and severity of complications and higher 30- and 90-day mortality. Patients who had an elective conversion for an unfavorable intraoperative finding had better outcomes than patients who had an emergency conversion secondary to an unfavorable intraoperative event in terms of HDU and total hospital stay, severity of complication, and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS:: Our study highlights the risk factors for conversion and suggests that conversion for unfavorable intraoperative events is associated with worse outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The past 25 years have seen the increased use of minimally invasive surgery. The development of these techniques has impacted the domain of liver surgery. This study aimed to describe the safety, feasibility, benefits and results of laparoscopic liver resection in a single tertiary care centre. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2005 and December 2016 at the University Hospital of Basel. We selected all liver resections performed by laparoscopic surgery. To evaluate the results of the laparoscopic liver surgery, we chose the following data: the conversion rate from laparoscopy to open surgery, the median operating time, postoperative complications, the median length of stay following surgery and the median surgical margin in patients with malignant lesions. RESULTS: Of the 274 liver operations, 201 (73\%) were performed by open surgery and 73 (27\%) by laparoscopy. Sixty-nine laparoscopic liver resections were included in this study. The selected laparoscopic liver resections were performed in 65 patients: 38 men and 27 women. The median age was 59 (range 29-85) years. Forty resections were performed for malignant lesions and 29 (42\%) for benign diseases. The median operating time was 112 (range 50-247) minutes. The conversion rate was 19\%. The most common cause for conversion was bleeding (69\% of all conversions, 13\% of all patients). Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (22\%). The median hospitalisation time was 7.1 (range 2-23) days. Thirty-two patients (46.5\% of all patients) had hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean tumour size was 25.6 (range 5-55) mm. The median surgical margin was 9 mm. CONCLUSION: This study showed that in our centre laparoscopic liver surgery is a safe and effective treatment option for both benign and malignant liver lesions.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To determine optimal settings for airway pressure (AWP), pneumoperitoneum pressure (PPP), and central venous pressure (CVP) in pure laparoscopic hepatectomy. Background: High PPP is often employed to control bleeding from the hepatic vein during pure laparoscopic hepatectomy; however, there is a risk of pulmonary gas embolism. We noted that decreases in AWP were often effective. Methods: After establishing carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in 6male piglets andmaintaining PPPat 25mmHg,CVPwas measured 3 times at each of 9 levels of airway pressure, which was increased in increments of 5 cmH2O from 0 to 40cmH2O. CVP was measured in the same manner by maintaining PPP at 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 mmHg, and in laparotomy. Correlation and regression analyses were performed among airway pressure, CVP, and pneumoperitoneum pressure. Results: Positive correlations were observed between AWP and CVP and between PPP and CVP (P<0.001). Under high airway pressure, CVP was persistently higher than pneumoperitoneum pressure. Under low airway pressure, CVP did not increase or often decreased when PPP was higher than CVP. Conclusions: By increasing pneumoperitoneum pressure, bleeding from the hepatic vein cannot be controlled under high airway pressure, but can be controlled under low airway pressure. However, under low airway pressure, the risk of pulmonary gas embolism increases when PPP is higher than CVP. We consider that reducing AWP is also effective for controlling bleeding from the hepatic vein and safer than increasing pneumoperitoneum pressure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even during laparoscopic hepatectomy, a technique is often required to expose the major vessels, for example, in anatomical hepatectomy. We have standardized and performed such laparoscopic hepatectomy as successfully as open hepatectomy.\n\n METHODS: We divide the liver parenchyma without pre-coagulation, exposing the major vessels using CUSA. To control the bleeding, we keep the central venous pressure low and often perform Pringle's maneuver. Over 49 months, we performed totally laparoscopic hepatectomies in 41 patients with the technique of exposing the major vessels. These included major hepatectomy in 7, sectorectomy in 17, segmentectomy in 14, and others in 3.RESULTS: The median operative time was 361 (range 176-605) minutes, with median blood loss of 216 (range 0-1600) g. The conversion rate was 4.9 \%. Postoperative morbidity rate was 9.8 \% (prolonged ascites in 1, port site infection in 1, peroneal palsy in 2). Mortality was zero. The median length of hospital stay after surgery was 8 (range 5-28) days. No local recurrence was found at the time of writing.\n\n CONCLUSIONS: By using our standardized procedure exposing the major vessels, we could raise the quality of laparoscopic hepatectomy toward the level of open hepatectomy significantly.},

   abstract = {Background: A large amount of blood flows in and out of the liver through the inflow system consisting of the portal vein and hepatic artery within the Glissonean cord and the outflow system constituted by the hepatic veins. Methods: During liver parenchymal dissection, useful methods to maintain a dry operative field are to control the inflow system with the Pringle maneuver and the outflow system by managing the central venous pressure. Additionally, mature techniques of dissecting the liver parenchyma, which can prevent injury to the blood vessels and appropriately and promptly stop bleeding, are fundamental. Similar to archaeological excavation, in which buried remains are unearthed and exposed in intact form, the Glissonean cords and hepatic veins buried in the liver parenchyma should be exposed or isolated without causing injury to these structures during liver parenchymal dissection. Results: The cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) is useful as a surgical device for excavation because it has multiple functions in one device. However, there have been no systematic guidelines on how to use it effectively during hepatectomy. Conclusion: We herein describe how to use the CUSA, based on our knowledge and experiences.},

   abstract = {Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has become popular as a surgical treatment for liver diseases, and numerous recent studies indicate that it is safe and has advantages in selected patients. Because of the magnified view offered by the laparoscope under pneumoperitoneal pressure, LH results in less bleeding than open laparotomy. However, gas embolism is an important concern that has been discussed in the literature, and experimental studies have shown that LH is associated with a high incidence of gas embolism. Major hepatectomies are done laparoscopically in some centers, even though the risk of gas embolism is believed to be higher than for minor hepatectomy due to the wide transection plane with dissection of major hepatic veins and long operative time. At many high-volume centers, LH is performed at a pneumoperitoneal pressure less than 12 mmHg, and reports indicate that the rate of clinically severe gas embolism is low. However, more studies will be necessary to elucidate the optimal pneumoperitoneal pressure and the incidence of gas embolism during LH. © 2012 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery and Springer.},

   abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has now been widely performed in experienced centers. However, hepatic vein injury (HVI) during LH is especially dangerous, because it may cause conversion, air embolization, fatal hemorrhaging, or even death. Materials and Methods: Perioperative characteristics of 4 patients who underwent LH suffering HVI were recorded, including 2 for right HVIs, 1 for middle HVI, and 1 for left HVI. Ultrasonic shears was used for liver mobilization. Linear stapler was adopted to cut off hepatic vein. A 4-0 prolene was used to repair HVI. Results: In case 1 laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy was performed for hepatic hemangioma. The root of right hepatic vein was injured. Repairing time was about 10 minutes and hemorrhaging was about 150 mL. In case 2 laparoscopic segmentectomy for S 7 and S 8 was performed for hepatic hemangioma. The right hepatic vein was injured. Repairing time was about 8 minutes and hem-orrhaging was about 220 mL. In case 3 laparoscopic tri-segmentectomy for S 2-S 4 + S 5 , S 8 was performed for hepatic echinococcosis. The middle hepatic vein was injured. Repairing time was about 8 minutes and hemorrhaging was about 110 mL. In case 4 laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy was performed for hepatocellular carcinoma. The left hepatic vein was injured. Repairing time was about 7 minutes and hemorrhaging was about 80 mL. All the HVIs were successfully repaired by a 4-0 #20 pro-lene. No complications were observed. Conclusions: Skillful stitching, experienced surgeons, and smooth cooperation can effectively handle HVI. However, conversion to laparotomy should be performed timely if uncontrolled hemor-rhaging occurs, to ensure patients' safety.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the "learning curve" effect on feasibility and reproducibility of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: LLR is currently limited to few centers and to few procedures. Its reproducibility is still debated. METHODS:: Patients undergoing LLR between 1996 and 2008 were included. Indications and type of hepatectomies were compared with those of open resections performed in the same period, considering 3 periods (1996-1999, 2000-2003, and 2004-2008). LLRs were divided into 3 equal groups of 58 cases and technical data and outcomes were compared. Risk-adjusted Cumulative Sum model was used for determining the learning curve based on the need for conversion. RESULTS:: Of 782, 174 (22.3\%) patients underwent LLR. Proportion of LLR progressively increased (17.5\%, 22.4\%, and 24.2\%), such as hepatocellular carcinoma (17.6\%, 25.6\%, and 39.4\%, P < 0.05), colorectal metastases (0\%, 6.5\%, and 13.1\%, P < 0.05), major hepatectomies (1.1\%, 9.1\%, 8.5\%, P < 0.05), and right hepatectomies (0\%, 13.2\%, and 13.1\%, P < 0.05). Comparing groups, results of LLR significantly improved in terms of conversion rate (15.5\%, 10.3\%, and 3.4\%, P < 0.05), operative time (210, 180, and 150 minutes, P < 0.05), blood loss (300, 200, and 200 mL, P < 0.05), and morbidity (17.2\%, 22.4\%, and 3.4\%, P < 0.05). Pedicle clamping was less used over time (77.6\%, 62.1\%, and 17.2\%, P < 0.05) and for shorter durations (45, 30, and 20 minutes, P < 0.05). Having adjusted for case-mix, the Cumulative Sum analysis demonstrated a learning curve for laparoscopic hepatectomies of 60 cases. CONCLUSION:: A slow but constant evolution of LLR occurred: indications and magnitude of procedures increased and technical outcomes improved. The learning curve demonstrated in this study suggests that LLR is reproducible in liver units but specific training to advanced laparoscopy is required.

   abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic major hepatectomy (LMH) is an innovative procedure that is still in the exploration phase. Although new surgical techniques have learning curves, safety should be maintained from the onset. This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safe introduction of LMH. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from 245 consecutive patients who underwent pure laparoscopic liver resection. Patients were divided into three groups: Phase I, the first 64 cases, all minor hepatectomies; Phase II, cases from the first LMH case to the midmost of the LMH cases (n = 69, including 22 LMHs); Phase III, the most recent 112 cases, including 22 LMHs. Patient characteristics and surgical results were evaluated, and the learning curve was analysed with the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method. Results: The first LMH was adopted after sufficient preparatory experience was gained from performing 64 minor hepatectomies. In cases of LMH, there were no significant differences in the surgical time between Phases II and III (356 vs. 309 min; P = 0.318), morbidity rate (22.7 vs. 31.8 \%; P = 0.736), or major morbidity rate (18.2 vs. 9.1 \%; P = 0.664); however, estimated blood loss was significantly reduced from Phase II to Phase III (236 vs. 68 mL; P = 0.018). The CUSUM for morbidity also showed similar outcomes through Phases II and III. Conclusion: There is a learning curve associated with laparoscopic liver resection. To maintain a low morbidity rate, 60 laparoscopic minor hepatectomies could provide adequate experience before the adoption of LMH.},

Studies confirming the possibility of a short and safe learning curve for laparoscopic hemihepatectomy could potentially benefit the further implementation of the technique. Objective: To evaluate the extent and safety of the learning curve for laparoscopic hemihepatectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospectively collected single-center database containing all laparoscopic liver resections performed in our unit at the University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Foundation Trust between August 2003 and March 2015 was retrospectively reviewed; analyses were performed in December 2015. The study included 159 patients in whom a total laparoscopic right or left hemihepatectomy procedure was started (intention-to-treat analysis), including laparoscopic extended hemihepatectomies and hemihepatectomies with additional wedge resections, at a tertiary referral center specialized in laparoscopic hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end pointswere clinically relevant complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III). The presence of a learning curve effect was assessed with a risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis. Results: Of a total of 531 consecutive laparoscopic liver resections, 159 patients underwent total laparoscopic hemihepatectomy (105 right and 54 left). In a cohort with 67 men (42\%), median age of 64 years (interquartile range [IQR], 51-73 years), and 110 resections (69\%) for malignant lesions, the overall median operation time was 330 minutes (IQR, 270-391 minutes) and the median blood loss was 500 mL (IQR, 250-925 mL). Conversion to an open procedure occurred in 17 patients (11\%). Clinically relevant complications occurred in 17 patients (11\%), with 1\% mortality (death within 90 days of surgery, n = 2). Comparison of outcomes over time showed a nonsignificant decrease in conversions (right: 14 [13\%] and left: 3 [6\%]), blood loss (right: 550 mL [IQR, 350-1150 mL] and left: 300 mL [IQR, 200-638 mL]), complications (right: 15 [14\%] and left: 4 [7\%]), and hospital stay (right: 5 days [IQR, 4-7 days] and left: 4 days [IQR, 3-5 days]). Risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis demonstrated a learning curve of 55 laparoscopic hemihepatectomies for conversions. Conclusions and Relevance: Total laparoscopic hemihepatectomy is a feasible and safe procedure with an acceptable learning curve for conversions. Focus should now shift to providing adequate training opportunities for centers interested in implementing this technique.},

   abstract = {Objective: We propose an objective and practical classification system to predict difficulty of different laparoscopic liver resections (LLRs). Background: Surgical difficulty is highly subjective and is not influenced only by surgical factors. Consequently, few series have described the degree of difficulty of LLR or attempted to objectively assess the surgical difficulty. Methods: From a prospectively maintained database between 1995 and 2015, patients undergoing LLR without simultaneous procedures were selected, and LLR procedures were divided into 3 groups according to scores based on operative time (< or ≥190 minutes), blood loss (< or ≥100 mL), and conversion rate (< or ≥4.2\%). Results: Altogether, 452 LLRs were divided into 3 groups based on their scores. Group I (0 point) included wedge resection and left lateral sectionectomy. Group II (2 points) included anterolateral segmentectomy and left hepatectomy. Group III (3 points) included posterosuperior segmentectomy, right posterior sectionectomy, right hepatectomy, central hepatectomy, and extended left/right hepatectomy. The rates of overall morbidity (groups I, II, and III: 8.4\%, 17.3\% and 45.7\%, respectively, P < 0.001) and major complications (1.1\%, 4.0\%, and 20.4\%, respectively, P < 0.001) increased significantly with a stepwise increase of groups from I to III (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This objective and practical classification system allows the stratification of LLR comprising the low (group I), the intermediate (group II), and the high (group III) grades.},

   abstract = {Background: Extending the clinical indications for laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) should be carefully considered based on a surgeon’s experience and skill. However, objective indexes to help surgeons assess the estimated difficulty of LLR are scarce. The aim of our study was to develop the first objective numerical rating scale to predict the surgical difficulty of various LLR procedures. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the operative outcomes of 187 patients who underwent a pure LLR. First, the value of preoperative factors for predicting surgical time was evaluated by multivariate linear regression analyses, and a scoring system was constructed. Next, the integrity of our predictive linear model was evaluated against the documented operative outcomes for patients forming our study group. Results: Four predictive factors were identified and scored based on the weighted contribution of each factor predicting surgical time: extent of resection (scored 0, 2, or 3); location of tumor (scored 0, 1, or 2); obesity (scored 0 or 1); and platelet count (scored 0 or 1). The scores were summed to classify surgical difficulty into three levels: low (total score ≤1); medium (total score 2–3); and high (total score ≥4). Operative outcomes, including surgical time, volume of blood loss, length of hospital stay, and rate of morbidity, were significantly different between the three surgical difficulty levels. Conclusion: Our novel model will be useful for surgeons to predict the difficulty of an LLR procedure relative to their own experience and skill.},
