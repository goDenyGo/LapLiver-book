abstract = {In the late 1980s, laparoscopy was essentially a gynecologist's tool. One of the French private surgeons, Phillipe Mouret of Lyon, shared his surgery practice with a gynecologist and thus had access to both laparoscopic equipment and to patients requiring laparoscopy. In March of 1987, Mouret carried out his first cholecystectomy by means of electronic laparoscopy. Although he never published anything about this experience, the news on his technique reached Francois Dubois of Paris. Although having no prior laparoscopic experience, Dubois acted immediately. He borrowed the instruments from gynecologists, performed his first animal experiments and, in April 1988, carried out the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in Paris. Inspired by Dubois, Jacques Perissat of Bordeaux, introduced endoscopic cholecystectomy in his clinic and presented this technique at a SAGES meeting in Louisville in April 1989. Very soon, news of the French work in LC soon swept beyond the country's borders. Dubois and Perissat spoke enthusiastically about their work at the meetings and were largely responsible for establishing what is today called the French technique.},

This report describes our experience with three women who had benign lesions of the liver edge found incidentally during laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic symptoms. The first women was managed traditionally with subsequent exploratory laparotomy; she developed ileus postoperatively and required a 5-day hospital stay. The other two were managed laparoscopically without incident. Each was hospitalized less than 24 hours. All three liver lesions proved benign on histologic examination. Although not all liver lesions can or should be excised laparoscopically, selected superficial neoplasms can be managed expediently by a laparoscopic approach.},

abstract = {The beginnings of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) were at the start of the 1990s, with the initial reports being published in 1991 and 1992. These were followed by reports of left lateral sectionectomy in 1996. In the years following, the procedures of LLR were expanded to hemi-hepatectomy, sectionectomy, segmentectomy and partial resection of posterosuperior segments, as well as the parenchymal preserving limited anatomical resection and modified anatomical (extended and/or combining limited) resection procedures. This expanded range of LLR procedures, mimicking the expansion of open liver resection in the past, was related to advances in both technology (instrumentation) and technical skill with conceptual changes. During this period of remarkable development, two international consensus conferences were held (2008 in Louisville, KY, United States, and 2014 in Morioka, Japan), providing up-to-date summarizations of the status and perspective of LLR. The advantages of LLR have become clear, and include reduced intraoperative bleeding, shorter hospital stay, and - especially for cirrhotic patients-lower incidence of complications (e.g., postoperative ascites and liver failure). In this paper, we review and discuss the developments of LLR in operative procedures (extent and style of liver resections) during the first quarter century since its inception, from the aspect of relationships with technological/technical developments with conceptual changes.},

abstract = {Congenital solitary liver cysts are a common finding, but they are usually asymptomatic; however, symptoms occur in about 16{\%} and then require treatment. Ideally, complete or partial resection of the cyst is the treatment of choice but always implies invasive surgery. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman suffering from a massively enlarged cyst in the left liver lobe. We decided to resect the extraphepatic part of the cyst by laparoscopic surgery. The patient was discharged absolutely asymptomatic 3 days following surgery. We conclude that open resection of symptomatic congenital liver cysts should be replaced by laparoscopic removal when cysts are mostly extrahepatically located. The laparoscopic procedure combines the advantages of minimal invasive surgery with the demand for a radical effective treatment.},

Two women, 24 and 62 years of age, were first seen with abdominal pain. A diagnosis of hemangioma was made in each case, and both lesions were removed laparoscopically. Operative blood loss was 200 cc in each case, and neither patient required transfusion. Diets were started on the first postoperative day (POD), and the patients were discharged on the second and fourth PODs without narcotic analgesia. If the size and location of the tumor are favorable, laparoscopic resection of liver hemangiomata can be performed safely.

@article{Buell2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current world position on laparoscopic liver surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Multiple series have reported on the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic liver surgery. Small and medium sized procedures have become commonplace in many centers, while major laparoscopic liver resections have been performed with efficacy and safety equaling open surgery in highly specialized centers. Although the field has begun to expand rapidly, no consensus meeting has been convened to discuss the evolving field of laparoscopic liver surgery. METHODS: On November 7 to 8, 2008, 45 experts in hepatobiliary surgery were invited to participate in a consensus conference convened in Louisville, KY, US. In addition, over 300 attendees were present from 5 continents. The conference was divided into sessions, with 2 moderators assigned to each, so as to stimulate discussion and highlight controversies. The format of the meeting varied from formal presentation of experiential data to expert opinion debates. Written and video records of the presentations were produced. Specific areas of discussion included indications for surgery, patient selection, surgical techniques, complications, patient safety, and surgeon training. RESULTS: The consensus conference used the terms pure laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopy, and the hybrid technique to define laparoscopic liver procedures. Currently acceptable indications for laparoscopic liver resection are patients with solitary lesions, 5 cm or less, located in liver segments 2 to 6. The laparoscopic approach to left lateral sectionectomy should be considered standard practice. Although all types of liver resection can be performed laparoscopically, major liver resections (eg, right or left hepatectomies) should be reserved for experienced surgeons facile with more advanced laparoscopic hepatic resections. Conversion should be performed for difficult resections requiring extended operating times, and for patient safety, and should be considered prudent surgical practice rather than failure. In emergent situations, efforts should be made to control bleeding before converting to a formal open approach. Utilization of a hand assist or hybrid technique may be faster, safer, and more efficacious. Indications for surgery for benign hepatic lesions should not be widened simply because the surgery can be done laparoscopically. Although data presented on colorectal metastases did not reveal an adverse effect of the laparoscopic approach on oncological outcomes in terms of margins or survival, adequacy of margins and ability to detect occult lesions are concerns. The pure laparoscopic technique of left lateral sectionectomy was used for adult to child donation while the hybrid approach has been the only one reported to date in the case of adult to adult right lobe donation. Laparoscopic liver surgery has not been tested by controlled trials for efficacy or safety. A prospective randomized trial appears to be logistically prohibitive; however, an international registry should be initiated to document the role and safety of laparoscopic liver resection. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic liver surgery is a safe and effective approach to the management of surgical liver disease in the hands of trained surgeons with experience in hepatobiliary and laparoscopic surgery. National and international societies, as well as governing boards, should become involved in the goal of establishing training standards and credentialing, to ensure consistent standards and clinical outcomes.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic liver resection is increasingly used for the surgical treatment of liver tumors. However, high-level evidence to conclude that laparoscopic liver resection is superior to open liver resection is lacking. METHODS Explanatory, assessor-blinded, single center, randomized superiority trial recruiting patients from Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway from February 2012 to January 2016. A total of 280 patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 133) or open (n = 147) parenchyma-sparing liver resection. The primary outcome was postoperative complications within 30 days (Accordion grade 2 or higher). Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, postoperative hospital stay, blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. RESULTS The postoperative complication rate was 19{\%} in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 31{\%} in the open-surgery group (12 percentage points difference [95{\%} confidence interval 1.67-21.8; P = 0.021]). The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic surgery (53 vs 96 hours, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas there were no differences in blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly from the laparoscopic group (0 patients) to the open group (1 patient). In a 4-month perspective, the costs were equal, whereas patients in the laparoscopic-surgery group gained 0.011 quality-adjusted life years compared to patients in the open-surgery group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing parenchyma-sparing liver resection for colorectal metastases, laparoscopic surgery was associated with significantly less postoperative complications compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic resection was cost-effective compared to open resection with a 67{\%} probability. The rate of free resection margins was the same in both groups. Our results support the continued implementation of laparoscopic liver resection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present surgical and oncological outcomes using a prospective and randomized trial (LapOpHuva, NCT02727179) comparing minimally invasive liver resection (LLR) versus open liver resection (OLR) in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). METHODS: Between February 2005 and March 2016, 204 selected patients with CRLM were randomized and 193 were included: LLR (n = 96) and OLR (n = 97). The primary endpoint was to compare postoperative morbidity. Other secondary endpoints were oncological outcomes, use of the Pringle maneuver, surgical time, blood losses, transfusions, hospital stay, mortality and OS, and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3, 5, and 7 years. RESULTS: LLR presented with lower global morbidity (11.5{\%} vs. 23.7{\%}, p = 0.025) but with similar severe complications. Long-term survival outcomes were similar in both groups. The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-year OS for LLR and OLR were 92.5{\%}, 71.5{\%}, 49.3{\%}, 35.6{\%} versus 93.6{\%}, 69.7{\%}, 47.4{\%}, 35.5{\%}, respectively (log-rank = 0.047, p = 0.82). DFS for LLR and OLR was 72.7{\%}, 33.5{\%}, 22.7{\%}, and 20.8{\%} versus 61.6{\%}, 27.2{\%}, 23.9{\%}, and 17.9{\%}, respectively (log-rank = 1.427, p = 0.23). LLR involved more use of the Pringle maneuver (15.5{\%} vs. 30.2{\%}, p = 0.025) and a shorter hospital stay (4 vs. 6 days, p {\textless} 0.001). There were no differences regarding surgical time, blood losses, transfusion, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with CRLM, LLR presents similar oncological outcomes with the advantages of the short-term results associated with LLR.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of worldwide literature on laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) and compare short-term outcomes against open liver resections (OLR) by meta-analyses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There are no updated pooled data since 2009 about the current status and short-term outcomes of LLR worldwide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All English language publications on LLR were screened. Descriptive worldwide data and short-term outcomes were obtained. Separate analyses were performed for minor-only and major-only resection series, and series in which minor/major resections were not differentiated. Apparent case duplications were excluded. RESULTS: A set of 463 published manuscripts were reviewed. One hundred seventy-nine single-center series were identified that accounted for 9527 LLR cases worldwide. Minor-only, major-only, and combined major-minor series were 61, 18, and 100, respectively, including 32, 8, and 43 comparative series, respectively. Of the total 9527 LLR cases reported, 6190 (65{\%}) were for malignancy and 3337 (35{\%}) were for benign indications. There were 37 deaths reported (mortality rate = 0.4{\%}). From the meta-analysis comparing case-matched LLR to OLR (N = 2900 cases), there was no increased mortality and significantly less complications, transfusions, blood loss, and hospital stay observed in LLR vs OLR. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest review of LLR available to date with over 9000 cases published. It confirms growing safety when performed in selected patients and by trained surgeons, and suggests that LLR may offer improved patient short-term outcomes compared with OLR. Improved levels of evidence, standardized reporting of outcomes, and assuring proper training are the next challenges of laparoscopic liver surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The National Clinical Database (NCD) in Japan is a nationwide registry that collects the data of more than 1,200,000 surgical cases annually from over 3,500 hospitals. Based on the NCD data, this study compared the perioperative outcomes of major laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) with those of major open liver resection (OLR) using the propensity score matching method. METHODS We collected data on 15,191 major hepatectomy cases (929 major LLR cases and 14,262 major OLR cases), and investigated the short-term outcomes in well-matched groups. RESULTS In the LLR group, 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and operative mortality were 0.9{\%}, 1.7{\%}, and 1.7{\%} respectively. The mean blood loss in the LLR group (865.4 ± 1,148.2 ml) was significantly less than in the OLR group (1,053.8 ± 1,176.6 ml), and the median postoperative hospital stay for the LLR patients (21.37 ± 19.71 days) was significantly shorter than for the OLR patients (26.25 ± 24.53 days). The complication rate in the LLR group (16.4{\%}) was significantly lower than that in the OLR group (23.5{\%}). CONCLUSION LLR in selected patients is currently safely performed as well as OLR even in patients requiring major hepatectomy, associated with less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and fewer complications.},
