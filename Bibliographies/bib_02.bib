abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of worldwide literature on laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) and compare short-term outcomes against open liver resections (OLR) by meta-analyses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There are no updated pooled data since 2009 about the current status and short-term outcomes of LLR worldwide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All English language publications on LLR were screened. Descriptive worldwide data and short-term outcomes were obtained. Separate analyses were performed for minor-only and major-only resection series, and series in which minor/major resections were not differentiated. Apparent case duplications were excluded. RESULTS: A set of 463 published manuscripts were reviewed. One hundred seventy-nine single-center series were identified that accounted for 9527 LLR cases worldwide. Minor-only, major-only, and combined major-minor series were 61, 18, and 100, respectively, including 32, 8, and 43 comparative series, respectively. Of the total 9527 LLR cases reported, 6190 (65{\%}) were for malignancy and 3337 (35{\%}) were for benign indications. There were 37 deaths reported (mortality rate = 0.4{\%}). From the meta-analysis comparing case-matched LLR to OLR (N = 2900 cases), there was no increased mortality and significantly less complications, transfusions, blood loss, and hospital stay observed in LLR vs OLR. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest review of LLR available to date with over 9000 cases published. It confirms growing safety when performed in selected patients and by trained surgeons, and suggests that LLR may offer improved patient short-term outcomes compared with OLR. Improved levels of evidence, standardized reporting of outcomes, and assuring proper training are the next challenges of laparoscopic liver surgery.},

@article{Kokudo2020,
abstract = {We reviewed the progress made in the field of liver surgery over the past 50 years. The widespread use and improved outcomes of the hepatectomy were, primarily, due to pioneer surgeons who were responsible for technological advances and rapid improvements in the safety of the procedure in the last century. These advances included the hepatic functional evaluation used to determine the safety limit of liver resections, the introduction of intraoperative ultrasonography, and the development of innovative techniques such as portal vein embolization to increase the remnant liver volume. Cadaveric liver transplantation has been attempted since 1963. However, the clinical outcomes only began improving and becoming acceptable in the 1970s-1980s due to refinements in technology and the development of new immunosuppressants. Partial liver transplantation from living donors, which was first attempted in 1988, required further technological innovation and sophisticated perioperative management plans. Moreover, these developments allowed for further overall improvements to take place in the field of liver surgery. Since the turn of the century, advances in computation and imaging technology have made it possible for safer and more elaborate surgeries to be performed. In Japan, preoperative 3-dimensional simulation technology has been covered by health insurance since 2012 and is now widely used. An urgent need for real-time navigation tools will develop in the future. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was first used in 2007 and has led to the creation of a new surgical concept known as fluorescence navigation surgery. Laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery have solved the issue of large incisions, which used to be a major drawback of open liver surgery; however, further improvements are required in order to achieve the level of safety and accuracy observed during open liver resection when performing all minimally invasive procedures. In the near future, liver surgery will become more precise and less invasive due to substantial progress including the development of navigation surgery, cancer imaging, and minimally invasive surgery. This overview of the history of liver surgery over the past 50 years may provide useful insights for further innovation in the next 50 years.},

@article{Llovet2003,
abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cause of cancer, and its incidence is increasing worldwide because of the dissemination of hepatitis B and C virus infection. Patients with cirrhosis are at the highest risk and should be monitored every 6 months. Surveillance can lead to diagnosis at early stages, when the tumour might be curable by resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneous treatment. In the West and Japan, these treatments can be applied to 30{\%} of patients, and result in 5-year survival rates higher than 50{\%}. Resection is indicated among patients who have one tumour and well-preserved liver function. Liver transplantation benefits patients who have decompensated cirrhosis and one tumour smaller than 5 cm or three nodules smaller than 3 cm, but donor shortage greatly limits its applicability. This difficulty might be overcome by living donation. Most HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and receive palliative treatments, which have been assessed in the setting of 63 randomised controlled trials during the past 25 years. Meta-analysis shows that only chemoembolisation improves survival in well-selected patients with unresectable HCC.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims We aimed to develop a prognostic classification scheme with treatment guidance for Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We collected data from 3856 patients with HCC predominantly related to hepatitis B treated at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong from January 1995 through December 2008. Data on patient performance status, Child-Pugh grade, tumor status (size, number of nodules, and presence of intrahepatic vascular invasion), and presence of extrahepatic vascular invasion or metastasis were included, and randomly separated into training and test sets for analysis. Cox regression and classification and regression tree analyses were used to account for the relative effects of factors in predicting overall survival times and to classify disparate treatment decision rules, respectively; the staging system and treatment recommendation then were constructed by integration of clinical judgments. The Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) classification was compared with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification in terms of discriminatory ability and effectiveness of treatment recommendation. Results The HKLC system had significantly better ability than the BCLC system to distinguish between patients with specific overall survival times (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, approximately 0.84 vs 0.80; concordance index, 0.74 vs 0.70). More importantly, HKLC identified subsets of BCLC intermediate- and advanced-stage patients for more aggressive treatments than what were recommended by the BCLC system, which improved survival outcomes. Of BCLC-B patients classified as HKLC-II in our system, the survival benefit of radical therapies, compared with transarterial chemoembolization, was substantial (5-year survival probability, 52.1{\%} vs 18.7{\%}; P {\textless}.0001). In BCLC-C patients classified as HKLC-II, the survival benefit of radical therapies compared with systemic therapy was even more pronounced (5-year survival probability, 48.6{\%} vs 0.0{\%}; P {\textless}.0001). Conclusions We collected data from patients with HCC in Hong Kong to create a system to identify patients who are suitable for more aggressive treatment than the currently used BCLC system. The HKLC system should be validated in non-Asian patient populations and in patients with different etiologies of HCC. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the AGA Institute.},

@article{Cucchetti2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS Both hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are considered curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their economic impact still remains not determined. Aim of the present study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness (CE) of these two strategies in early stage HCC (Milan criteria). METHODS As first step, a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature of the last decade was performed. Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 3996 patients underwent resection and 4424 underwent RFA for early HCC. Data obtained from the meta-analysis were used to construct a Markov model. Costs were assessed from the health care provider perspective. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate outcomes with distribution samples of 1000 patients for each treatment arm. RESULTS In a 10-year perspective, for very early HCC (single nodule {\textless}2cm) in Child–Pugh class A patients, RFA provided similar life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy at a lower cost than resection and was the most cost-effective therapeutic strategy. For single HCCs of 3–5cm, resection provided better life-expectancy and was more cost-effective than RFA, at a willingness-to-pay above €4200 per quality-adjusted life-year. In the presence of two or three nodules ⩽3cm, life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy were very similar between the two treatments, but cost-effectiveness was again in favour of RFA. CONCLUSIONS For very early HCC and in the presence of two or three nodules ⩽3cm, RFA is more cost-effective than resection; for single larger early stage HCCs, surgical resection remains the best strategy to adopt as a result of better survival rates at an acceptable increase in cost.},

abstract = {This document presents official recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur-ring in the setting of adults with cirrhosis. Unlike pre-vious AASLD practice guidelines, the current guideline was developed in compliance with the Insti-tute of Medicine standards for trustworthy practice guidelines and uses the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. (1) Multiple systematic reviews of the litera-ture were conducted to support the recommendations in this practice guideline. An enhanced understanding of the guideline can be obtained by reading the appli-cable portions of the systematic reviews. In addition, more detailed information may be found in the associ-ated guidance document related to clinically important aspects of HCC that lacked sufficient evidence to war-rant a systematic review. The guideline focuses on a broad spectrum of clinical practice, including surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for HCC, establishing the diagnosis of HCC, and vari-ous therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC. To address other issues on HCC such as epidemiology, stag-ing, and additional aspects of diagnosis and treatment, the authors have created a new guidance document that will be published soon and is based upon the previous HCC AASLD guidelines by Bruix and Sherman. (2) KEY QUESTIONS The guideline developers from the AASLD identi-fied key questions that health care providers are faced with frequently in the evaluation and management of patients with HCC. These questions were: 1. Should adults with cirrhosis undergo surveillance for HCC? If so, which surveillance test is best? 2. Should adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC undergo diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic Abbreviations: AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Potential conflict of interest: Laura M.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Anatomic resection (AR) of the tumor-bearing portal territory has been reported to be associated with a decreased recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, because of the heterogeneity of the study populations, its oncologic advantage remains controversial. The objective of the present study was to determine the clinical advantage of AR for primary HCC, based on the data from a large prospective cohort treated under a constant surgical policy. Methods In 209 Child-Pugh class A patients with primary, solitary HCC measuring ≤5.0 cm in diameter, which was resectable either by AR or limited resection (non-AR), the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared with patients in whom complete AR was achieved and those who eventually ended up with non-AR after adjustment for the propensity scores to select AR. Advantages of AR in disease-specific survival and local recurrence were also evaluated by competing-risks regression to clarify the true oncologic impact of AR. Results The AR group showed better DFS than the non-AR group (HR, 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.99; p = 0.046), while no significant difference was observed in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.46-1.48; p = 0.511). Competing-risks regression revealed that AR significantly decreases local recurrence (HR, 0.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.30; p {\textless}0.001) and improves disease-specific survival (HR, 0.50; 95{\%} CI, 0.28-0.90; p = 0.020), while the other cause of death was highly influenced by patient age ({\textgreater}65 years) (HR, 7.51; 95{\%} CI, 2.16-26.04; p = 0.002) and not associated with AR.

We sought to evaluate the available evidence on oncologic outcomes, as well as the clinical efficacy and safety of AR versus NAR performed as the primary treatment for HCC patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane library through April 15th, 2017. Only clinical studies comparing AR versus NAR were deemed eligible. RESULTS A total of 43 studies were considered eligible (total 12,429 patients: AR, n = 6839 (55{\%}) versus NAR, n = 5590 (45{\%})). Blood loss was higher among patients undergoing AR (mean difference: +229.74 ml, 95{\%} CI: 97.09–362.38, p = 0.0007), whereas resection margin was slightly wider following AR versus NAR (mean difference: +0.29 cm, 95{\%} CI: 0.15–0.44, p {\textless} 0.0001). No difference was noted for perioperative complications (RR: 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.81–1.11, p = 0.49) and perioperative mortality (RR: 0.91, 95{\%} CI: 0.43–1.95, p = 0.82). AR was associated with a disease-free survival (DFS) benefit at 1- (HR: 0.79, 95{\%} CI: 0.68–0.92, p = 0.002), 3- (HR: 0.87, 95{\%} CI: 0.78–0.95, p = 0.004) and 5-years (HR: 0.87, 95{\%} CI: 0.82–0.93, p {\textless} 0.0001). AR also was associated with a decreased risk of death at 5-years (HR: 0.88, 95{\%} CI: 0.79–0.97, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Despite the high heterogeneity among studies, the data demonstrated that AR had comparable perioperative morbidity and mortality versus NAR. AR seemed to offer an advantage versus NAR in terms of DFS and OS among patients undergoing resection of HCC – especially among patients without cirrhosis. Thus, AR should be considered the preferred surgical option for patients with HCC when feasible.},

abstract = {Partial liver resections are the treatment of choice for patients with a malignant liver or bile duct tumor. The most frequent indications for partial liver resections are colorectal metastasis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. Liver resection is the only therapy with a chance for cure in these patients. Refinements in surgical technique and increasing experience have contributed to a reduction in perioperative morbidity and mortality in recent years. Despite these improvements, partial liver resections remain a major surgical procedure and carry the risk for excessive blood loss and a subsequent need for blood transfusion. Blood transfusions have been associated with systemic side effects, such as depression of the immune system. Several studies have suggested that perioperative blood loss or transfusions have a negative impact on postoperative outcome. However, it has been debated whether this is due to a real cause-effect relationship or merely the result of more complicated surgery. We have reviewed the literature concerning studies focusing on the relationship between blood loss and blood transfusion during liver surgery for malignant tumors and postoperative outcome. Most studies were based on a retrospective analysis of single center experiences, using uni- and multivariate statistical methods. Most studies have demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant association between blood transfusion and postoperative mortality and morbidity, especially postoperative infectious complications. The effect of blood transfusions on tumor recurrence and more long-term mortality is much less clear and evidence varies depending on the type of malignancy. The strongest indication that blood transfusion may have an impact on tumor recurrence has been found for patients with early stages of HCC. However, overall, no such effect could be demonstrated for patients undergoing partial liver resection for late stages of HCC, colorectal liver metastasis or cholangiocarcinoma.},

@article{Ishii2014,
abstract = {Liver resection is the gold standard treatment for certain liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver tumors. Some patients with such tumors already have reduced liver function due to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis before surgery. Therefore, complications due to poor liver function are inevitable after liver resection. Although the mortality rate of liver resection has been reduced to a few percent in recent case series, its overall morbidity rate is reported to range from 4.1{\%} to 47.7{\%}. The large degree of variation in the post-liver resection morbidity rates reported in previous studies might be due to the lack of consensus regarding the definitions and classification of post-liver resection complications. The Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification of post-operative complications is widely accepted internationally. However, it is hard to apply to some major post-liver resection complications because the consensus definitions and grading systems for post-hepatectomy liver failure and bile leakage established by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery are incompatible with the CD classification. Therefore, a unified classification of post-liver resection complications has to be established to allow comparisons between academic reports.},

abstract = {Although the utility of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized in recent years, the impact of the laparoscopic liver resection for HCC with complete liver cirrhosis (F4) is still unknown. Retrospective analysis of 56 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC (3 cm or smaller in a diameter) and had complete liver cirrhosis (F4) diagnosed histologically was performed. Of the 56 patients, partial hepatectomy was performed under laparotomy in 28 patients (laparotomy group) or under laparoscopy in 28 patients (laparoscopy group). Perioperative outcome was analyzed in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the results of the preoperative liver function tests and the operation time between the two groups. The intraoperative blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group than the laparotomy group (p = 0.0003). The incidence of the postoperative complications was significantly higher in the laparotomy group (20/36 patients) than in the laparoscopy group (3/28 patients, p {\textless} 0.0001). The incidences of surgical site infection, especially incisional infection, and intractable ascites were significantly higher in the laparotomy group than in the laparoscopy group (p = 0.0095, p {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). The proportions of patients who were classified into Clavien's grade I and IIIa were higher in the laparotomy group than in the laparoscopy group (p = 0.0043, p = 0.051, respectively). The duration of the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopy group than in the laparotomy group (p {\textless} 0.0001). The postoperative morbidity, such as surgical site infection and intractable ascites, decreased by the induction of laparoscopic liver resection in patients with liver cirrhosis. As the results, the necessity of invasive treatment for postoperative complications decreased and the duration of the postoperative stay was shortened.},

abstract = {Studies that compare laparoscopic to open liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients are rare and may have suffered from low patient numbers. This work was designed to determine the impact of laparoscopic resection on postoperative and long-term outcomes in a large series of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with open resection. From 2002 to 2009, 36 patients with chronic liver disease with complicating HCC were selected for laparoscopic resection (laparoscopic group, LG). The outcomes were compared with those of 53 patients who underwent open hepatectomy (open group, OG) during the same period in a matched-pair analysis. The two groups were similar in terms of tumor number and size and number of resected segments. Morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the two groups (respectively 25 and 0{\%} in LG vs. 35.8 and 7.5{\%} in OG; p = 0.3). Severe complications were more frequent in OG (13.2{\%}) than in LG (2.8{\%}; p = 0.09). Despite similar portal hypertension levels, complications related to ascites (namely evisceration or variceal bleeding) were fatal in 4 of 12 affected patients in OG but 0 of 5 cases in LG (p = 0.2). The mean hospitalization durations were 6.5 ± 2.7 days and 9.5 ± 4.8 days in LG and OG, respectively (p = 0.003). The surgical margins were similar in the two groups. Although there was a trend toward better 5-year overall survival in LG (70 vs. 46{\%} in OG; p = 0.073), 5-year disease-free survival was similar (35.5 vs. 33.6{\%}). Laparoscopic resection of HCC in patients with chronic liver disease has similar results to open resection in terms of postoperative outcomes, surgical margins, and long-term survival.},

Short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus open resection for HCC and PVH-PLT were compared. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the clinicopathological differences between MIS and non-MIS patents. Univariate comparison and standard survival analyses were utilized. Among 1974 patients who underwent surgery for HCC, 13{\%} had a PVH-PLT and 33{\%} underwent MIS. After 1:1 PSM, 407 MIS and 407 non-MIS patients were analyzed. Incidence of complications and length-of-stay (LoS) were higher among non-MIS versus MIS patients (both p ≤ 0.002). After PSM, among 178 PVH-PLT patients (89 MIS and 89 non-MIS), patients who underwent a non-MIS approach had longer LoS ({\textgreater} 7 days; non-MIS: 55{\%} vs. MIS: 29{\%}), as well as higher morbidity (non-MIS: 42{\%} vs. MIS: 29{\%}) [p {\textless}0.001]. In contrast, long-term oncological outcomes were comparable, including 3-year overall survival (non-MIS: 66.2{\%} vs. MIS: 72.9{\%}) and disease-free survival (non-MIS: 47.3{\%} vs. MIS: 50.2{\%}) [both p ≥ 0.08]. An MIS approach was associated with improved short-term outcomes, but similar long-term outcomes, compared with open liver resection for patients with HCC and PVH-PLT. An MIS approach for liver resection should be considered for patients with HCC, even those individuals with PVH-PLT.},

abstract = {Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common malignancy arising from the liver. ICC makes up about 10{\%} of all cholangiocarcinomas. It arises from the peripheral bile ducts within the liver parenchyma, proximal to the secondary biliary radicals. Histologically, the majority of ICCs are adenocarcinomas. Only a minority of patients (15{\%}) present with resectable disease, with a median survival of less than 3 years. Multidisciplinary management of ICC is complicated by large differences in disease course for individual patients both across and within tumor stages. Risk models and nomograms have been developed to more accurately predict survival of individual patients based on clinical parameters. Predictive risk factors are necessary to improve patient selection for systemic treatments. Molecular differences between tumors, such as in the epidermal growth factor receptor status, are promising, but their clinical applicability should be validated. For patients with locally advanced disease, several treatment strategies are being evaluated. Both hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with floxuridine and yttrium-90 embolization aim to downstage locally advanced ICC. Selected patients have resectable disease after downstaging, and other patients might benefit because of postponing widespread dissemination and biliary obstruction.},

abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has become an essential method for treating malignant liver tumors. Although the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of LLR in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported, there are few reports of LLR for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). Methods: Patients who underwent liver resection for T1 or T2 IHCC between March 2010 and March 2015 in Gyeongsang National University Hospital were enrolled. They were divided into open (n = 23) and laparoscopic (n = 14) approaches, and the perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared. Results: The Pringle maneuver was less frequently used (p = 0.015) and estimated blood loss was lesser (p = 0.006) in the laparoscopic group. There were no significant differences in complication rate (p = 1.000), hospital stay (p = 0.371), tumor size (p = 0.159), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.127), and the number of retrieved lymph nodes (p = 0.553). The patients were followed up for a median of 21 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 74.7 and 55.2 {\%}, respectively. No differences were observed in the 3-year OS (75.7 vs 84.6 {\%}, p = 0.672) and RFS (56.7 vs 76.9 {\%}, p = 0.456) rates between the open and laparoscopic groups, even after the groups were divided into patients that received liver resection with or without lymph node dissection. Conclusion: LLR for IHCC is a treatment modality that should be considered as an option alongside open liver resection in selected patients.},

This study aims to retrospectively assess the beneficial histopathological features and surgical procedures in long-term survivors (i.e., patients surviving perihilar cholangiocarcinoma for at least 2 y). MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 322 patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma underwent surgery at our center. The follow-up ended in 2017; 76 patients survived for {\textgreater}2 y. The type of resection, UICC stage, and histopathological features were compared between three survival groups ({\textgreater}2-3, {\textgreater}3-5, and {\textgreater}5 y). RESULTS The {\textgreater}5-year-survival rate in our selected study cohort was 43.4{\%} ({\textgreater}3-5 y,31.6{\%} and {\textgreater}2-3 y, 25.0{\%}), and 14.5{\%} of the patients survived for {\textgreater}10 y after surgery. Patients with non-regional lymph node positive tumors and/or distant metastasis (i.e., UICC stage IVb; p=0.0112), R2 status (p=0.0288), and exploratory laparotomy only (p=0.0157) showed the poorest survival rates. Perineural invasion had no significant impact on the overall survival. However, 29.0{\%} patients surviving for {\textgreater}5 y displayed the lowest perineural infiltration prevalence. Interestingly, Bismuth-Corlette stage IIIa (p=0.0467), especially caudate lobectomy (p=0.0034), was associated with disease-specific overall survival of {\textgreater}5y. CONCLUSION Complete/extended tumor resection with additional caudate lobe resection is strongly associated with long-term survival. Perineural infiltration as a negative prognostic marker for prolonged survival needs to be evaluated in larger study cohorts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To clarify the importance of different patterns of infiltration at the proximal border of hilar bile duct carcinomas. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA There are few detailed pathologic studies on the proximal resection margins in patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma. METHODS Serial sections of 62 specimens of resected hilar bile duct carcinoma were examined histologically to determine the involved layers and routes of invasion at the proximal border. The degree of cancer extension was determined, and the relation between the length of the tumor-free resection margin and postoperative anastomotic recurrences was analyzed. RESULTS Mucosal extension was predominant in papillary and nodular tumors, but submucosal extension was predominant in diffusely infiltrating and nodular-infiltrating tumors. Submucosal extension usually consisted of direct or lymphatic invasion. The mean length of submucosal extension was 6.0 mm. Superficial spread of cancer, defined as mucosal extension of more than 20 mm from the main lesion, was seen in 8 specimens. No patient had an anastomotic recurrence when the tumor-free resection margin was greater than 5 mm. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of infiltration at the proximal border of resected hilar bile duct carcinomas is closely related to the gross tumor type. The length of submucosal extension is usually less than 10 mm. Superficial spread of cancer is seen in more than 10{\%} of cases. A tumor-free proximal resection margin of 5 mm appears to be adequate in hilar bile duct carcinoma.},

abstract = {Hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction for biliary malignancy remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the indications for surgery. Patients with advanced hilar bile duct cancer (HBDC) (n = 26) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) involving the hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 13) who underwent hepatectomy were enrolled. They were divided into two groups on the basis of whether vascular reconstruction was performed (HBDC, 10 yes vs. 16 no; GBC, 5 yes vs. 8 no). Portal vein (PV) reconstruction was performed on the right branch in seven patients and on the left branch in two; hepatic artery (HA) reconstruction was done on the right branch in 11 patients and on the left branch in 1. Five patients with HBDC and one with GBC underwent both PV and HA reconstruction. Patency rates were 88.0{\%} and 83.3{\%} for PV and HA reconstructions, respectively. Vascular reconstruction-related morbidity occurred in one patient with fatal liver failure owing to a portal thrombus and in two patients with multiple liver abscesses caused by arterial obstruction. Microsurgery eliminated reconstruction-related morbidity. Mortality in vascular reconstruction cases was 13.3{\%} (2/15), and in those without reconstruction it was 8.3{\%} (2/24). Curability rates (R0 and R1+R2) were 50.0{\%} and 56.0{\%} for HBDC and 40.0{\%} and 62.5{\%} for GBC, respectively. The 3-year survivals of HBDC patients were, respectively, 33{\%} and 42{\%}, and the 5-year survivals were 18{\%} and 25{\%}, whereas for GBC the 1-year survivals were 20{\%} and 60{\%} and the 2-year survivals 0{\%} and 25{\%}. Two patients with vascular involvement who underwent PV with HA reconstruction survived more than 3 years. Hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction for selected HBDC patients offers low surgical risk and increased survival by curable resection, but it is not recommended for advanced GBC.},

abstract = {Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts is defined as an adenocarcinoma arising in proximal, middle third, and distal (lower third) parts of extrahepatic ducts. As anatomically a division of the duct system into thirds is artificial, novel classifications distinguish perihilar/hilar cholangiocarcinomas from those of the mid-region and the distal part of the common bile duct. For the definition of perihilar cancers, the separation point between intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumors is defined by the level of second-order bile ducts. Bile ducts located to the hepatic plate of the hilum correspond to extrahepatic bile ducts. The growth patterns and associated clinical sequelae vary as a function of anatomical location. Perihilar/hilar tumor forms concentrically stenosing lesions (Klatskin tumors). Tumors in the mid-region more commonly present as tubular lesion with thickening of the duct wall, whereas distal tumor more often shows an exophytic growth pattern. Histologically, the neoplasms are adenocarcinomas of the cholangiocyte lineage, usually associated with abundant stroma (desmoplasia). The cancers have a strong tendency for perineural and intraneural invasion, extension along bile ducts, and lymphatic spread.},

@article{Mizuno2019,
abstract = {Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is a highly intractable malignancy. One of the reasons for its intractability is that most patients with the disease are diagnosed with an advanced stage of the disease at their initial presentation. Surgical resection is the standard therapy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, providing a chance for a cure, and an aggressive surgical approach substantially increases the number of resectable tumors that are initially regarded as unresectable tumors. The success and standardization of the aggressive approach is warranted by meticulous preoperative management that prevents fatal postoperative complications. Extended resection procedures, including hepatic trisectionectomy for Bismuth type IV tumors, hepatopancreaticoduodenectomy for tumors with extensive longitudinal tumor spreading, and combined vascular resection with reconstruction for tumors with the involvement of hepatic vascular structures, have been challenged to expand the surgical indication. Due to acceptable surgical/survival outcomes, the three extended procedures are currently regarded as extended but standard options in specialized hepatobiliary centers. Although it remains a controversial multidisciplinary approach, the combination of these extended procedures with an adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment is a promising approach for further improving the resectability of tumors and the survival of patients.},
